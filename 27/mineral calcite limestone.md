Limestone rocks contain more than 50% calcium carbonate mineral. Extensive karst forms in limestone areas as the minerals react chemically with dissolved carbon dioxide and organic acids. Although calcite is usually the most abundant mineral other common minerals include aragonite dolomite and magnesite (magnesium carbonate).

## calcite limestone manufacturing 
Limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral foraminifera and molluscs.Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).A closely related rock is dolomite which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite CaMg(CO 3) 2.

A sedimentary rock composed dominantly of calcium carbonate. i. A sedimentary rock consisting chiefly (more than 50% by weight or by areal percentages under the microscope) of calcium carbonate primarily in the form of the mineral calcite and with or without magnesium carbonate; specifically a carbonate sedimentary rock containing more than 95% calcite and less than 5% dolomite.

 · The key difference between limestone and chalk is that the limestone contains both minerals calcite and aragonite whereas chalk is a form of limestone which contains calcite.. Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock.It mainly contains different crystal forms of calcium carbonate. Therefore this mineral is highly alkaline. Chalk is a form of limestone.

## What is Limestone? 
Limestone a common sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral calcite (CaCO3). Limestone constitutes approximately 10 percent of the sedimentary rocks exposed on the earth's surface. It forms either by direct crystallization from water (usually seawater) or by accumulation of shell and shell fragments.

It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate cement lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.
