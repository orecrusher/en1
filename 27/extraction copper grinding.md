This new copper technology utilizes smelter acid to produce copper from oxidized ores and mine wastes. Today worldwide approximately 20% of all copper produced is produced by this is process.

An ore is a rock containing enough valuable mineral to make it worth extracting. In the case of copper it is worth extracting when there is about 2 kg of copper per 1000 kg of ore (0.2%). Copper minerals are found in over one hundred varieties although only a few have been worked for copper on a large scale.
