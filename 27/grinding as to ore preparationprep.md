## THE EFFECTS OF PROCESS VARIABLES ON THE GRINDING OF IRON ORE
The aim of grinding is to bring the ore to the mesh-of-grind (product size) required to obtain optimum liberation size in which the valuable mineral is just released from the ore matrix (Wright et al. 2001). Further grinding after the liberation size leads to waste of energy. The finer the ore is ground the more is this grinding cost (Wills

 · The grinding efficiency is low the energy consumption is high and the product is easily crushed which affects the sorting effect and economic benefits. Practice has shown that the more difficult to grind the ore the less economically reasonable it is to use one-stage grinding process for fine grinding.

Multiply this 16 times for all the weapons which adds to a 8000 ore in total.
