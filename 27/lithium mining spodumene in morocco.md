The primary lithium-bearing mineral in this ore is usually spodumene and therefore most of these mines produce spodumene concentrate as the final product. The spodumene concentrate is then usually sold and shipped to lithium hydroxide or carbonate conversion plants mostly loed in Asia where it is converted to these respective lithium chemical products.
