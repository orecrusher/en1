## Eccentric Shaft 
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended as in the gyratory but is supported in a curved universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.

## TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS 
5.1.1 Cone crushers Cone crushers are commonly used for secondary tertiary and quaternary crushing duties. Two variations are available - standard and short head The chief difference between cone and gyratory or jaw crushers is the nearly parallel arrangement of the mantle and the cone at the discharge end in the cone crusher.

## What is the eccentric throw? — SRP 
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber – it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.
