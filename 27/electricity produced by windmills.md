## Wind Power! Designing a Wind Turbine 
You can measure how much electricity (voltage) is produced with a voltmeter. Engineers design wind turbines that turn the kinetic energy of the wind (the movement of the wind) into mechanical or electrical power. So when does a wind turbine work best? The power produced by a wind turbine depends on elevation wind speed and air temperature.

## Electrical Energy 
Windmills or wind turbines produce electricity by using the power of the wind and converting it. Wind energy turns the blades of windmills to produce mechanical energy which is then converted into electrical energy. This method of harnessing energy has been used for centuries but only recently for the production of electrical energy.

## 27 Pros And Cons Of Wind Energy You Need To Know 
In the power production process with coal or other fossil fuels the fuels have to be transported over quite long distances to power plants in order to be able to generate electricity. However with wind energy those transportation processes are not necessary at all since windmills only need sufficient amounts of wind in order to produce energy.

## How electricity is produced 
How is wind power produced? Wind power is one of the cleanest ways of generating electricity. It basically involves transforming the force exerted by the wind on the three-propeller windmills into electricity creating mechanical energy that is transferred to a series of copper wires where the electricity is generated. The elements that transform wind into energy are the so-called wind turbines.

## Which energy is produced in a windmill
Wind turbines operate on a simple principle. The energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft which spins a generator to create electricity. Also Wind energy (or wind power) describes the process by which wind is used to generate electricity.
