## Jaw Crusher Components 
If the crusher can not break things into the crushing chamber accidentally when the jaw is not easy to break objects these bolts will be cut. This will prevent damage to the rest of the crusher. Unlike gyratory crushers the primary lubricant used on jaw crushers is grease rather than oil.

## The 5 best cabin loions on any cruise ship
 · Rear-facing balcony cabins are among the best balcony cabins on any ship. Often their balconies are bigger than balconies on side-facing cabins. And they also feel quiet. There are far fewer balcony cabins at the back of a ship than on the sides of a ship so you don't hear a lot of noise wafting from your neighbors.

The three types of crushers most commonly used for crushing CDW materials are the jaw crusher the impact crusher and the gyratory crusher (Figure 4.4). A jaw crusher consists of two plates with one oscillating back and forth against the other at a fixed angle ( Figure 4.4(a) ) and it is the most widely used in primary crushing stages ( Behera et al. 2014 ).

Flywheels are often used to provide continuous power output in systems where the energy source is not continuous. For example a flywheel is used to smooth fast angular velocity fluctuations of the crankshaft in a reciproing engine. In this case a crankshaft flywheel stores energy when torque is exerted on it by a firing piston and returns it to the piston to compress a fresh charge of
