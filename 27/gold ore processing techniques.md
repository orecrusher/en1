## Mining Technology in the Nineteenth Century 
Ore processing technologies extract economically valuable minerals and metals. They include the collection of naturally occurring metals and minerals (e.g. placer gold or lode silver) crushing and grinding ores mechanical concentration of ores containing metals and minerals and breaking down the ores with chemical heat and electrical processes.

## Gold extraction 
Normally the ore is crushed and agglomerated prior to heap leaching. High grade ores and ores resistant to cyanide leaching at coarse particle sizes require further processing in order to recover the gold values. The processing techniques can include grinding concentration roasting and pressure oxidation prior to cyanidation.

 · Metallurgical processing of metalliferous ores in general and gold ores in particular consists essentially of three stages often colloquially referred to as: Bashing (crushing); Mashing (grinding); and. Hashing (extraction/recovery) In the context of flowsheet selection the bashing and mashing stages are relatively straightforward.

Extract copper and gold from low-grade ores more efficiently. Ore deposits are becoming increasingly complex to treat and grades continue to deteriorate in known reserves. For instance approximately 15-20 per cent of the world's current gold production involves refractory ores that must be pre-treated prior to downstream recovery by cyanidation.
