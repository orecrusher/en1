## underground block cave mining method 
Block caving is an underground hard rock mining method thatinvolves undermining an ore bodyallowing it to progressively collapse under its own weight. It is the underground version of open pit mining. In block caving a large section of rock is undercut creating an artificial cavern that fills with its own rubble as it collapses.

## Block caving mining method with Elfen software explained 
Block caving is a mining method that relies upon natural forces to break the rock. The cave is initiated by an undercut where a large area beneath the mining block is removed; gravity induced stresses then develop within the rock causing it to fracture. The fracturing process is progressive and affects the entire rock mass overlying the undercut.

## Block Caving Underground Mining Method
Block caving is an underground hard rock mining method that involves undermining an ore body allowing it to progressively collapse under its own weight. It is the underground version of open pit mining. In block caving a large section of rock is undercut creating an artificial cavern that fills with its own rubble as it collapses.
