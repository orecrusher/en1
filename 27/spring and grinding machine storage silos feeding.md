## Feeding baled silage 
 · However feeding silage is much different than feeding hay. Silage because it is much wetter than hay is much more susceptible to deterioration. When sealed from oxygen during storage the forage undergoes fermentation. However when it is once again exposed to air (when it is fed) it can still deteriorate quickly.

## FEEDERS AND STORAGE SILOS 
 · Silos are used in agriculture to store grain (see grain elevators) or fermented feed known as silage. Silos are more commonly used for bulk storage of grain coal cement carbon black woodchips food products and sawdust.

## Silo Discharge 
Silo Discharge. Failures to discharge from silos or hoppers mainly occur as a result of two different types of blockage: stable arching or rat-holing. In both cases the strength of the bulk solid is higher than the gravitational stresses meaning that the structures are stable. The stresses in these structures increase as the size of the arch

## Vibrating Feeder Design 
The fast efficient high-tonnage method of reclaiming coal from concrete storage silos is to use a series of feeders to extract uniformly across the entire bottom of the silo. For example a 70 ft. diameter silo would use seven feeders loed beneath 10 ft. square openings three directly over a belt and two on either side to provide mass-flow unloading while minimizing segregation problems.
