## MANAGERIAL REVIEW Examining the copper value chain
(TC/RC). Often expressed as e.g. 60/60 or 100/100. That means that the mining company has to pay 60 USD/ton of concentrate to be processed and 60 ct/lb for the copper content to be refined to the hode. So the revenues for the concentrate depend also on the copper content in the ore. There may be other effects on the economy of a smelter:

The probes are made of Copper wire and Copper has a Seebeck coe cient comparable with other metals used to make thermocouples. Thus unless both ends of each probe wire are at the same temperature the probes themselves will contribute an additional EMF to the circuit.

 · The 2018 TC/RC benchmarks were set at $82.25 per tonne and 8.225 cents per pound respectively. The charges typically fall when the copper concentrate market tightens. Antaike forecasts that annual copper smelting capacity in China the world's biggest copper consumer will increase by 950000 tonnes in 2019 on top of an expected 1.08 million tonnes of additions this year.
