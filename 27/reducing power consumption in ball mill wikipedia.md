 · Wet grinding often takes place in ball pebble or rod mills. The efficiency of wet grinding can be higher than that for dry grinding but wear of equipment is also higher [2]. Most size-reduction equipment is subject to heavy wear and therefore parts such as casing liners hammers and jaws are designed for relatively easy replacement.

## Mill power draw models 
Mill Power Draw Models. The mill power draw models are used to predict how much power will be consumed by a particular type of mill mill geometry and set of mill operating conditions. This power is transferred to the ore and used to predict the throughput when combined with the specific energy consumption models.

## Size Reduction 
To produce fine powders it is recommended to mill in several steps while reducing successively the milling media size as one milling step usually induces a particle size reduction of about factor 10. An increase in ball to powder ratio increases the impact frequency and the total energy consumption per second while the average impact energy

## High
High-energy ball milling is effective in getting well-dispersed slurry. 7−9 The preparation procedure is summarized in Fig. 24.2.First commercially available PZT powders ( 850) were high-energy ball milled to get the desired particle size. Secondly a selected dispersant was added to the milled powders to get the surface-modified powders.

## Best energy consumption 
 · Grinding energy was approximately 50 per cent of the ball mill and the drying capabilities allowed direct processing of materials of up to 20 per cent moisture content. The main energy issue was the high power consumption of mill fans with pressure drops of 100mbar not uncommon with high nozzle ring velocities (>70m/s) and internal mill circulating loads of >1000 per cent.

Grinding activities in general (including coarse intermediate and fine grinding) account for 0.5 pct of U.S. primary energy use 3.8 pct of total U.S. electricity consumption and 40 pct of total U.S. mining industry energy use. Large energy saving opportunities have been identified in grinding in particular.
