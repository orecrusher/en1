## Modern Processing Techniques to minimize cost in Cement 
Grinding is a highly energy intensive process in the cement industry. Approximately 60 – 70 % of the total electrical ene rgy used in a cement plant is utilised for the grinding of raw materials coal and clinker. Various technological improvements from the conventional ball mills in this area include:
