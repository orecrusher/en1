## Belt Scale Manual 
Belt Scales enable material to be weighed on a conveyor whilst in motion. A Belt Scale differs from a static weighing system such as a bin weighing system in that the Belt Scale is required to measure two variables. The first variable is the actual weight on the conveyor belt and the second variable is the actual belt speed or belt travel.

## Belt Scales – Bulk Pro Systems
A belt conveyor scale is a device that continuously measures bulk material as it moves along a conveyor. The system requires two general parameters to operate. First it needs to know the weight of the material being moved along the conveyor belt and second it needs to know the speed at which it's moving along the conveyor belt.

 · To correctly material test a conveyor belt scale you should run three weighed material samples. The first two tests are used to determine a repeatable error if any. Each material sample should be run across the conveyor belt scale continuously at a rate over 50% of the scale's rated capacity. You may find after the first two tests that the
