## Could robot machining be the future of agile manufacturing 
 · The robot can produce parts that simply couldn't be achieved by the five-axis machine they had considered purchasing" says Jason. "They got a hybrid mix of a flatbed router and five-axis CNC machine in one robot system." Another crucial differentiator with the robot machining approach is thorough training.

## The rise of robots in machining 
 · Robots will not be replacing machine tools any time soon for a wide range of machining appliions that require high precision afforded in part by the 'stiffness' of machine tools. However given the greater flexibility of robots across a wide range of tasks including machining manufacturers should assess their overall production requirements and determine where the use of robots makes

## Robotic machining 
Robotic machining is becoming more and more popular. In comparison with machining centers robot machining offers far greater flexibility in terms of possible appliions and above all a larger operating range. Adding a biaxial positioner to a robot gives you two more axes that are controlled synchronously with the robot motion.
