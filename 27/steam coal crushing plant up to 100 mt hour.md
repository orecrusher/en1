Based on 100 hectares we can get tons copra. Different place the production is different. If you an inform the capacity according to the production of last year. it will be better. So we calculate the capacity based on 150tons. Then 150/300=0.5tons per 8 hours. Use our smallest oil press machine YZS-85 with capacity: 60kg/hour is ok.
