Zinc plating is prohibited on EEE parts and associated hardware. In some appliions use of Zinc plating may be acceptable via a Project approved waiver process that includes review and approval by both Materials and Parts Engineering disciplines. There are several reasons for prohibiting the use of Zinc plating in space flight electronic systems.

## Cadmium
Cadmium occurs naturally in zinc lead copper and other ores which can serve as sources to ground and surface waters especially when in contact with soft acidic waters. Major industrial releases of cadmium are due to waste streams and leaching of landfills and from a variety of operations that involve cadmium or zinc.

## Cadmium 
Cadmium sits right below zinc on the periodic table and therefore shares many of its same chemical properties. In the environment it is distributed nearly everywhere we find zinc and therefore when we mine zinc we consequently mine cadmium. When we galvanize (zinc treat) a nail or some other bit of steel a little cadmium comes along for the ride.
