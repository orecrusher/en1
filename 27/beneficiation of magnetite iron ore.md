## magnetite iron ore beneficiation process
26/10/2020 Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore and magnetite as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purifiion. Hematite however responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite so it is the preferred type of ore.

## ISSUES RELATING TO CHARACTERIZATION AND BENEFICIATION 
Different iron minerals associated with iron ore samples are shown in Table 1. Most of the samples contain hematite martite magnetite and goethites. In the iron ores of Barajamda and Barbil areas magnetite is mostly altered to martite and rarely relicts of magnetite in martite are observed. (Figure1).
