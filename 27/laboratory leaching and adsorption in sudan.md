## Effect of Peat Addition on Sorption and Leaching of 
In this paper the authors treat the impact of peat amendment on sorption and leaching of fungicides penconazole and flusilazole in two Algerian topsoil samples (Misserghine and Es-Senia). The batch equilibration technique was applied for adsorption experiments and leaching was tested through soil column simulated experiments under laboratory conditions.

Carbon Adsorption Kinetics. Gold is typically recovered from solution by adsorption on to activated carbon in a carbon in pulp (CIP) or carbon in leach (CIL) circuit. The kinetics of this adsorption process is slow so industrial practice is to load the carbon far short of the equilibrium loading potential.
