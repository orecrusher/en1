## What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)
Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore and magnetite as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purifiion. Hematite however responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite so it is the preferred type of ore.
