## Limestone uses — Science Learning Hub
Calcium oxide obtained from limestone acts as a pH regulator when extracting gold from quartz. The chemical extraction of gold from powdered quartz rock uses a solution of sodium cyanide. In this cyanidation process the pH of the solution needs to be maintained between 10–11 to prevent the production of deadly hydrogen cyanide gas.

## Lime Production from Limestone 
 · An appliion of a chemical equilibrium for an industrial system is lime production from limestone. The products which are made from burnt limestone are called lime (ie. quicklime and hydrated lime). Limestone is naturally occurring and it also consits of minerals in small pieces. Presently limestone products are used as a crucial part in most industrial processes.

## How Does Limestone Affect the Environment?
 · Limestone mining can pollute water and create sinkholes. When limestone dissolves while it's still in the ground caves and gullies form a natural phenomenon known as karst. Although this doesn't hurt the environment in its natural form once the limestone is mined out sinkholes can form and disrupt underground waterways.

## What is limestone? 
What is Limestone? Limestone is an organic sedimentary rock. This means it was formed from the remains of tiny shells and micro-skeletons deposited on the sea bed. Over the years this sediment was compressed to form solid rock. Limestone is formed in layers - called bedding planes. These bedding planes contain vertical cracks called joints.

## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron 
 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.
