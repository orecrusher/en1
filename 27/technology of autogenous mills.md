Since the early 1980s we have been designing and manufacturing Semi-Autogenous (SAG) and Autogenous (AG) Grinding Mills under the Fuller-Traylor brand. Semi-autogenous grinding uses a minimal ball charge in the range of 6-15% while autogenous grinding uses ore only.

## Predicting the specific energy of autogenous and semi 
Abstract A rock breakage test has been developed that can help predict autogenous (AG) and semi-autogenous (SAG) mill performance in situations where only limited quantities of rock samples are available. The test was originally developed to make use of quartered (slivered) core but whole core half core and lump material can also be used. Original core diameters in the range 27–85 mm are

## Autogenous and Semi
 · For autogenous mills like the dry Aerofall mills MacPherson and Turner established that the power consumption was a function of mill diameter and length. For dry commercial AG mills they derived the power as (9.8) P M = 0.992 L D 2.8 ρ c where ρ c = bulk density of the mill charge (rock plus balls and water) (t/m 3 )
