## THE CHALLENGE OF COAL PREPARATION
The coal preparation plant cost may comprise 5-15% of the cost of a coal mine. A thermal dryer requires 2-5 minutes of processing time even though the throughput is only for 5-20% of the prep plant processing rate. These numbers thus can translate directly to much higher processing costs for fine coal versus coarse coal.
