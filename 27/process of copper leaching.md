Heap leaching is the method most commonly chosen for copper recovery from oxide ores. An acidic solution is used to leach the metal dissolving the copper into what is referred to as a pregnant leach solution (PLS). This solution is collected and purified by solvent extraction (SX). SX is a two-step process of loading the copper into an organic

The leaching of sulfide minerals distinguishes bioleaching from conventional acid leaching. Bioleaching involves the use of microorganisms to alyze the oxidation of iron sulfides to create ferric sulfate and sulfuric acid. Bioleaching is used today in commercial operations to process ores of copper nickel cobalt zinc and uranium.

Modelling copper heap leaching Leaching implies a reaction between solid particles and a liquid phase. The "shrinking core" model describes the leaching process of an idealized oxide copper ore particle [1]. This particle reacts from the surface inwards. During the continuous reaction a leached rim is formed composed mainly of gangue.
