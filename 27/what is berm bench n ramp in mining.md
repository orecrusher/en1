 · 1. ramp volume reduced (fill ramps) 2. contour areas easier to drill blast. 3. ore grading and selective mining is easier. 4. multi-row blasts easier to blast. 5. single pass drilling easier. Disadvantages. 1. poor bench grade control by shovel is accentuated. 2. reduced drilling yield and increased drill and blast cost.

## Optimization of the ch bench design using a genetic 
 · Therefore ch bench width is one of the important considerations when designing bench geometry. To improve the functionality of the ch bench a berm is added at the edge of the bench to increase the retaining capacity of the ch bench. Moreover the berm can provide safety for mining vehicles used in the clearance of fallen rock fragments.

## Slope Design Considerations for Shallow Open Pit Mines: A 
 · The approach indied that appropriate slope design can be achieved by taking into account ramp design bench width and bench height and bench face angle. Based on these elements the overall slope angle will be determined with a balance between shallow angles providing a better safety factor and a steeper slope angle providing better economics due to a reduction in the strip ratio.
