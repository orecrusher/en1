## What Is Copper Smelting? (with pictures) 
Kirsten C. Tynan Copper wire. Copper smelting is the process of separating copper metal from the rock in which it is naturally embedded by melting it. This is accomplished through a series of several processing steps. The term copper smelting may refer to this melting step in particular or it may refer somewhat less formally to the entire process overall.
