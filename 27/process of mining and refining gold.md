## Refining Gold 
 · Gold usually exists in nature in combination with other rocks and minerals. Some of these such as silver and copper may also be precious or semi-precious but a variety of base metals are usually also present. Though several different techniques exist any process used to separate metal from impurities or unwanted material is called refining.

 · Afterwards the miners add carbon grains to the tank and the gold adheres to the carbon. The workers then filter the pulp through screens which sifts out gold-bearing carbon. The carbon goes to a stripping vessel where a hot solution pulls the gold out from the carbon. More screens filter carbon grains which get recycled for future processing.
