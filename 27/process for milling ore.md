Milling Ore Once at the production facility it is put through a hammer mill to reduce it down to 200 mesh minus in particle size then fluxed and roasted to reduce ore to an oxide. It is then ball milled with steel balls to a nano particle size to achieve the highest yield and also the highest concentration level of whatever metal or element is desired to be processed.

Processing. Our mills run the ore through ball and rod mills to reduce it to the proper size for our flotation process. Flotation separates the copper zinc and lead. After separation the various concentrates are dried to the consistency of a damp powder before being stored in our enclosed storage and shipping facility.
