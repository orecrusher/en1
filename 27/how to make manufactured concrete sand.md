## How Concrete is Made 
How Concrete is Made. In its simplest form concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates or rocks. The paste composed of portland cement and water coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like mass known as concrete.
