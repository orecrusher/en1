 · Blast furnace – basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) dominates production (71%) and is particularly stubborn to any decarbonization technology. Direct reduced iron to electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) production is 5% and growing it appears to have better decarbonization potential to move towards net-zero.

## Electric Arc Furnace 
 · Electric Arc Furnace means an extremely hot enclosed space where heat is produced by means of electrical arcing for melting certain metals such as scrap steel without changing electro-chemical properties of the metal. Here electric arc is produced between the electrodes. This electric arc is used for melting the metal.

Production processes. Ferro-alloys are usually produced by the reduction of a metallic ore (generally oxide) by carbon with the addition of electric energy in a "Submerged Arc Furnace" (smelting process); or by metals (metallo-thermic reduction) usually aluminium or silicon. High carbon ferro-manganese is produced by the reduction of manganese

Electric arc furnace (EAF) develops During the 19th century a number of men had employed an electric arc to melt iron. Sir Humphry Davy conducted an experimental demonstration in 1810; welding was investigated by Pepys in 1815; Pinchon attempted to create an electrothermic furnace in 1853; and in 1878–79 Sir William Siemens took out patents for electric furnaces of the arc type.

## Energy Use in US Steel Manufacturing 
Electric Arc Furnace. In an electric arc furnace (see Fig. 2) scrap steel and solid pig iron is melted using an electric arc. The electric current passes through the steel heating it a high degree. Since electricity is used to heat the metal new steel can be created entirely from scrap steel.

The slag is used for paving and ballast in civil engineering works and the gas for generating electricity. The iron from the blast furnace is then further refined and converted to steel in the basic oxygen furnace (BOF). Depending on the plant 20-30% of scrap is added to this process primarily to regulate the temperature. In the Electric Arc

## Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) 
The electric arc furnace (EAF) is the major producer of hot metal in the steel industry today. There are two types of EAFs: alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). AC EAFs have three electrodes while DC EAFs have two: a hode which is a single electrode in the roof of the furnace and an anode in the bottom of the furnace.

## Iron and Steel Manufacturing 
Steel is manufactured by the chemical reduction of iron ore using an integrated steel manufac-turing process or a direct reduction process. In the conventional integrated steel manufacturing process the iron from the blast furnace is con-verted to steel in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF). Steel can also be made in an electric arc furnace

CO 2abatement measures and technologies for BOFs and EAFs are covered in Chapters 7 and 8 respectively. Recycling wastes generated within and outside the steelworks can help reduce overall CO 2emissions per tonne of steel produced.

 · As these production routes do not require carbon an electric arc furnace is used instead of a blast furnace. Steel scrap or solid-state reduced so-called sponge iron is smelted in a furnace using an arc produced by electric current. The proportion of electric arc furnaces in steel production is expected to increase in the future.
