A first atmospheric bubbling fluidized bed furnace is combined with a second turbulent circulating fluidized bed furnace to produce heat efficiently from crushed solid fuel. The bed of the second furnace receives the smaller sizes of crushed solid fuel unreacted limestone from the first bed and elutriated solids extracted from the flu gases of the first bed.

## Fast Fluidized Incineration System
Unlike the kiln or stoker type incinerator heat is stored in the circulating fluid sand and in the chamber section which leads to very high heat efficiency and energy-saving operation. Features Sand is circulated at high speed (5m/s) in the furnace where sludge is crushed instantly and combustion efficiency is increased significantly as compared to the fluidized-bed incineration method.

## A novel suspension
 · A novel suspension-floating-circulating fluidized combustion technology is proposed for burning coal slurry fuel in traditional circulating fluidized bed boilers (CFBB). This technology can solve some existing problems in large-capacity CFBB burning coal slurry. The principles of the suspension-floating-circulating fluidized combustion technology were introduced in detail in this paper.
