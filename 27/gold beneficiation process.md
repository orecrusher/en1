## Beneficiation process of gold ore_MECRU
Beneficiation process of gold ore. The gold content in the ore is extremely low. In order to extract gold the ore needs to be crushed and grinded and pre-enriched or separated from the ore by the beneficiation method. In gold beneficiation gravity separation and flotation are used more frequently.

## Selective attachment processes in ancient gold ore 
 · A sufficient charge results in an electrostatic attachment that can be utilized for selective dry gold separation. The sensitivity of the process renders the appliion of this technique difficult. In modern gold beneficiation electrostatic separation via triboelectricity has been tested but has no practical use (Inculet et al. 1988).
