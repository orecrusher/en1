## Using coal? But what for? – Jean
 · The amount of coal use for power generation has almost quadrupled over the period. More seriously these three main uses of coal result in the fact that it is not only an energy for "emerging" countries but also an energy for (very) rich countries because the latter also have coal fired power plants and steel mills.

## How to Calculate the Coal Quantity Used in a Power Plant 
 · Coal trader's web sites give base prices in the international market. We take a coal price of around 65 $ / Ton. The cost of coal consumed by 100 MW power plant is (53.8 x 65) 3497 $ /hr. A 100 MW unit produces 100000 units of electricity. So the cost of coal per unit of electricity is (3497/100000) 3.5 cents per unit.

## How much coal goes into a wind turbine? 
 · Now a coal-fired plant has a capacity factor of ~87% and a typical wind turbine only manages ~25%. So it takes about 3.5 MW of wind power to generate as much electricity as 1 MW of coal power assuming the wind blows. So it takes about 1020 tons of coal to offset 1 MW of coal-fired capacity with 1 MW of wind capacity.
