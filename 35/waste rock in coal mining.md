acid drainage from sulﬁde tailings and mine wastes. Gautama and Hartaji (2004) studied the accuracy of geo-chemical rock modeling based on the static test of coal mine samples in East Kalimantan. Kinetic testing was conducted to analyze the long-term behavior of rock samples being classiﬁed as potential acid forming by the static test.

## waste rock in coal mining 
Coal mining and coal combustion in power plants produce several types of wastes: The mining process itself produces waste coal or solid mining refuse which is a mixture of coal and rock; The mining process also produces liquid coal waste which is then stored in impoundments; Pollution control equipment used for coal combustion produces coal ash or fly ash as well as flue-gas.
