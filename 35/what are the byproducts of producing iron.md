Byproducts consist of 0.2 to 0.4 tons of slag and 2.5 to 3.5 tons of blast furnace gas containing up to 100 pounds (lb) of dust. The molten iron and slag are removed or cast from the furnace periodically. The casting process begins with drilling a hole called the taphole into the clay-filled iron notch at the base of the hearth.

## Iron 
Iron deficiency progresses from depletion of iron stores (mild iron deficiency) to iron-deficiency erythropoiesis (erythrocyte production) and finally to iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [89]. With iron-deficiency erythropoiesis (also known as marginal iron deficiency) iron stores are depleted and transferrin saturation declines but hemoglobin levels are usually within the normal range.
