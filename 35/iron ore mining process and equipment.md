The ore which in the ground consists of 25 to 45 % iron by weight is pelletized at processing plants adjacent to each mine. The life-of-mine stripping ratio in the hematite pit is about one-half to one and in the magnetite pit it is about one to one.

## Ore sorting: Efficiently optimise the treatment of ores in 
By using ore sorting equipment ore concentrates can be created at very low cost in small or remote mining installations. The entire processing line can be planned in semi-mobile form and consists only of crushers screens belts and sorting machines. This allows immense cost savings for transport since the waste rock is disposed of on-site.

## Iron Ore Mining 
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

 · The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the iron ore deposit which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent loion and value of the ore body.

Decreasing ore grades of existing or new iron ore deposits require predictive solutions to efficiently sort and blend iron ore for optimal and profitable beneficiation and downstream processing. Elemental and mineralogical composition as well as predictive models for the upgradability based on metallurgical parameters such as washable constituents play an important role for iron ore producers.
