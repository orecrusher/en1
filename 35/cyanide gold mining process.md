Cyanide is used in mining to extract gold (and silver) from ores particularly in low-grade ores or ores that can not be readily treated through simple physical processes such as gravity. While cyanide-bearing solutions are used in mining because they react with gold they also react with other metals such as Cu Zn Co and Hg.

## What is Gold Cyanidation? (with picture) 
Gold cyanidation also called cyanide leaching is a process used to extract gold from raw ore taken from the ground. It uses cyanide to dissolve the gold within the rock which itself is not soluble in cyanide. The gold is then drawn out in a liquid form that can be treated to remove the cyanide. Almost 90% of all gold extracted commercially

## Chapter 4.7 Cyanide Management 
Cyanide Management BACKGROUND Cyanide is a chemical used in the processing of gold and silver at many mine sites and as a minor processing reagent at some base metal mines. If released to the environment or if improperly used in mineral processing cyanide can pose a risk to workers surrounding communities aquatic resources and wildlife.

## Gold cyanidation 
Cyanide's efficiency makes mining more wasteful Because cyanide leaching is very efficient it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades. Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold.

## How Cyanide Leaching is Used in Gold Mining 
 · The Cyanide Leaching Process has been the most widely used and most cost effective method of extracting gold from ore since the 1970's. Most open-pit gold mining operations around the world use a heap leaching to extract ores from these types of deposits. Consider that most of the largest gold mines in the world are mining what would be considered low-grade ore by most standards.

## Carbon Adsorption In Recovery Of Gold 
The gold adsorbs onto the surface of the carbon. The loaded carbon is periodically removed from the columns and sent to the stripping circuit. The carbon is then generally subjected to a heated solution (200 deg to 250 deg F) of (1%) sodium hydroxide and (0.1%) cyanide and the gold is re-dissolved and removed from the carbon surface.
