These were very simple rounded hearths in which iron ore and charcoal were heated to very high temperatures. By reheating ironworkers could hammer the metal to remove impurities and increase hardness. It was realised that by making high-quality iron very hot and adding a few other metallic elements an even stronger material could be produced.

Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel. 98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel. Uncontaminated iron ore is almost nameless on the exterior of the Earth apart from the combination of Fe-Ni alloys from meteorites and very atypical forms of unfathomable mantle xenoliths.
