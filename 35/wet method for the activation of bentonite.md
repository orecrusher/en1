## Activation of Jordanian Bentonite by Hydrochloric Acid and 
 · Jordanian bentonite was activated by hydrochloric acid at room temperature. FTIR XRD TGA and BET surface area analyses of the samples were carried out to examine the structure of bentonite before and after acid activation. It is found that the octahedral ions were removed which altered the chemical composition of the bentonite.
