 · The sludge digestion process is a two-phase process. In the first stage the dry solid sludge is heated and mixed in a closed tank to enable anaerobic digestion by acid-forming bacteria. These bacteria hydrolyze the large molecules of proteins and lipids present in the sludge and break them down into smaller water-soluble molecules which they then ferment into various fatty acids.

## Sludge Grinders and Drum Thickeners for Biosolids Processing
Sludge biosolids processing in a resource recovery facility is a critical operation for efficient running of any plant. For some facilities it is also the feed process into generating electricity harvesting biogas and producing reusable biosolids.

## HUBER Solutions for Sludge Thickening 
HUBER Solutions for Sludge Thickening. Thickening is the first step for reducing the sludge volume by removal of free sludge water. Thin sludge is concentrated to thick sludge. Thick sludge has a higher viscosity but must still be pumpable. Sludge settles in gravity thickeners and is compressed by the weight of its own solids.

CHAPTER 3 SLUDGE THICKENING Thickening is a procedure used to increase the solids content of sludge by removing a portion of the liquid fraction. To illustrate if waste activated sludge which is typically pumped from secondary tanks with a content of 0.8% solids can be thickened to a content of 4% solids then a fivefold decrease in sludge volume is achieved [1].

The gravity sludge thickening process. The gravity sludge thickener is mainly composed of two parts a deep cone circular thickening tank and a rake scraper. The solid particles suspended in the slurry in the thickening tank settle under gravity and the upper part becomes clarified water so that the solid and liquid can be separated.
