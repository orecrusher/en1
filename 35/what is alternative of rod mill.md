## Rod Mills 
 · Rod Mills may be considered either fine crushers or coarse grinding equipment. They are capable of taking as large as 2″ feed and making a product as fine as 35-48 mesh. Of particular advantage is their adaptability to handling wet sticky ores which normally would cause difficulty in crushing operations.

## Sizes of Wire Gauges
 · A rod (made in a rolling mill) is pulled through a hole whose diameter is slightly smaller than the rod's. This process is repeated through ever-smaller holes until the wire is as fine as desired. To reduce the number of steps for economy's sake the manufacturer would like the change in size at each drawing to be as large as possible.

## Consequentialism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
 · Consequentialism as its name suggests is simply the view that normative properties depend only on consequences. This historically important and still popular theory embodies the basic intuition that what is best or right is whatever makes the world best in the future because we cannot change the past so worrying about the past is no more useful than crying over spilled milk.

## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills
 · When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length. New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end. This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.
