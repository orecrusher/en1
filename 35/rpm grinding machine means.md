This means that the permanent magnet spindle has more torque at low RPM which is ideal for appliions like carbide grinding. Typical with an induction motor spindle the power will build up to its maximum torque at a certain RPM let's say around 4000 RPM. It will then pretty much maintain this torque across the rest of the RPM range.

The higher the RPM doesn't always mean it's better for concrete grinding. That's because you could wear off sections if not done properly creating pits and gouges. It's usually best to use a lower RPM (like a machine that runs at 175 rpm) and that has high torque for jobs like concrete grinding and polishing.

 · A 10" wheel is almost unsafe on a 3450 RPM grinder but a bit on the low side for 1750. 12" wheel is likely to burst on a 3450 RPM grinder but the peripheral speed is amlost perfect for 1750. A grinding wheel wears away in normal use. Ideally the grinder would have some means of varying the wheel RPM to mantain a constant peripheral speed.

Vibration is the enemy! Imbalance is the most common cause of vibration on grinding machines. Vibration can be eliminated by means of an active balancing system that monitors the signals from the vibration sensors (accelerometers) and the rotation speed (RPM) and corrects the imbalance by applying a manual adjustment (corrective weights on the grinding wheel support flange).

## What is RPM in a mixer grinder? 
 · For example if a mixer grinder has an RPM of 18000 it means that the mixer blades can rotate at speeds of 18000 rotations in one minute.. For a domestic mixer grinder an RPM in the range of 18000 to 23000 should be sufficient. The faster the blades rotate the better it can grind your masalas and chutneys. However faster rotations can affect your juicing jobs.
