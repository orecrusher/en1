The use of centrifugal gravity concentration in the closed-grinding circuit of a gold-containing massive sulphide ore was tested on classifier underflow and overflow. A continuous Knelson CVD6 was retrofitted to the hydrocyclone underflow for recovery of Au and Pb at a coarser feed size. The objective of treatment of overflow was recovering unliberated Au prior to flotation.

The PJV Dome Mill utilizes gravity concentration cyanide leaching and carbon in pulp gold circuits to recover gold. Gravity recovery has been used in some form at the Dome Mill for most of its existence first using conventional jigs these being replaced in 1993 by two Knelson Concentrators one for each of the two grinding circuits in the Dome mill.

 · 1. Background. For the past 100 years the key element in the processing of gold ore has been the cyanidation process. Over the years steady improvements have occurred in equipment design; milling has evolved from stamp mills through tube mills and ball mills to the large semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) and fullyautogenous grinding (FAG) circuits in modern gold plants.
