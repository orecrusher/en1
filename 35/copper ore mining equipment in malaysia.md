Malaysia no longer produces copper and silver (as a byproduct of copper mining) because the country's only copper mine the Mamut Mine near Ranau Sabah ceased operations in October 1999. As much as 70 per cent of the industry remained under foreign control. This was a legacy of the British colonial era; many British firms which had arrived

Malaysia ceased copper production all of it at the Mamut Mine in 1999; there were large reserves on Sabah and output was 131832 tons in 1985 before dropping to 13907 in 1998 and 4600 in 1999. As a result silver production most of which was a byproduct of copper mining dropped from 9647 kg in 1997 to 4 and 3 kg in 2000 and 2001 respectively.

## Equipment Selection for Surface Mining: A Review
A surface mine contains pits with mineral endowed rock (or ore). We extract ore that lies within the upper layer of the earth from surface mines (Fricke 2006)This ore can include metals such as iron copper coal and gold. There are several methods of surface mining including open-pit stripping dredging and mountain-top removal.
