## The Design of High Speed Belt Conveyors 
 · SUMMARY. This paper discusses aspects of high-speed belt conveyor design. The capacity of a belt conveyor is determined by the belt speed given a belt width and troughing angle. Belt speed selection however is limited by practical considerations which are discussed in this paper. The belt speed also affects the performance of the conveyor belt

Users should be aware that Positive Drive belts are limited on the heat they can withstand — they will start to show wear starting at 170 degrees Fahrenheit. For conveyor appliions involving high heat consider our other conveyor belting options or speak with a belting expert to determine the best-fit belt for your appliion.

## Optimal Conveyor Transfer Chute Design Considerations 
 · Conveyor transfer chutes deposit material onto a belt conveyor. This material might be delivered by truck and dropped into a hopper above the chute but most are used for belt-to-belt transfers. A belt-to-belt transfer chute is fed material from the upper conveyor. Typically material waterfalls off the belt into the head chute compartment.
