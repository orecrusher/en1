Pyrite was once used as a source of sulfur but is now only a minor ore for both sulfur and iron. Pyrite from some localities is auriferous and therefore is used as an ore of gold in gold-bearing localities.Pyrite was polished by the Native Americans in the early times and used as mirrors. Today it is used as an ornamental stone as well as a very popular stone for amateur collectors.
