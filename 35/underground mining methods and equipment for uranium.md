## Nuclear Fuel Cycle 
Mining: The primary step of course is extracting natural uranium from the rock in which it occurs. There are three established methods for doing so: open-pit mining underground mining and in-situleaching. In-situ leaching is only a viable option for porous rock types like sandstone.

## How Uranium Mining Works 
 · Underground mining calls for venturing deeper into underground mine systems where miners use shafts or adits (vertical and horizontal tunnels) to move equipment and position workers throughout the mine. As we'll discuss later mining underground for uranium poses higher health risks than other methods.

Uranium mining methods. Uranium ore is extracted from the ground in one of three ways: open pit mining underground mining or in-situ recovery. Open-pit mining When uranium ore is found near the surface generally less than 100 metres deep it is typically extracted by the open-pit mining method. Underground mining

## Uranium 
Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table.A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons of which 6 are valence electrons.Uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable; the half-lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159200 years and 4.5 billion years.

 · Most uranium is mined via one of three techniques: open pit underground or in-situ leach mining. This section aims to quantify the energy intensity of each. Fig. 2.1 is a schematic diagram of the mass flows associated with uranium mining milling and refining via open-pit or underground techniques.
