The flotation circuit process recovers gold-copper concentrate before the material is then processed by a traditional carbon-in-leach circuit where the remaining gold is recovered to produce doré. The processing plant has a nominal capacity to process approximately 40 million tonnes of ore per year with optimization projects underway to further increase this capacity.

For example one miner improved his recovery from 40% to 70% simply by screening his feed from 8mm to 2mm. No gold was lost because his largest gold was around .5mm. The iCON method will improve your process by screening your feed to the proper size. This will reduce the volume of feed and increase the percentage of gold that you recover.
