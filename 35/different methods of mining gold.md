## Gold 
Gold is obtained by two principal mining methods; placer and vein mining and also as a by product of the mining of other metals. Placer mining is used when the metal is found in unconsolidated deposits of sand and gravel from which gold can be easily separated due to its high density.

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

These different forms of surface mining are methods of extracting ores close to Earth's surface. Placers are valuable minerals found in stream gravels. California's nickname the Golden State can be traced back to the discovery of placer deposits of gold in 1848.

## Methods of Gold Mining 
Gold panning is mostly a manual technique of separating gold from other materials. Wide shallow pans are filled with sand and gravel that may contain gold. The pan is submerged in water and shaken sorting the gold from the gravel and other material.

Andrew P. Schissler in Encyclopedia of Energy 2004 2.3 Strip Mining. Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips. The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other. Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced called spoil handling.

Fortunately for the miners gold has an unusual quality: it is heavy and thus all early-day mining processes take advantage of this property. Another popular tool was the rocker or cradle and indeed this tool did vaguely resemble a child's cradle.

Most gold mined in Australia today cannot be seen in the rock it is very fine grained and mostly has a concentration of less than 5 grams in every tonne of rock mined. The feasibility of mining low concentrations of gold largely depends on the price of gold. Gold is bought and sold every day on international gold markets.

## Extremely Fine Gold Recovery 
 · Recovery is a process of eliminating non-gold products from gold. Gravity methods rely on separation based on mass. The particles must have nearly equal size and different mass to be separated. There is a limit to the process of screening to smaller and smaller particle sizes during the recovery of gold.

## New to Mining? Here are the Most Common Types of Mining 
 · Underground mining techniques have progressed significantly over the past years including using remote controlled machinery. Drills assist in creating holes descending underground. If miners are required to work underground drills can also be used in ensuring the holes are large enough to serve as a portal for miners to enter.

## Basic Gold Prospecting Exploration Methods
 · There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.

Placer mining takes advantage of gold's high density which causes it to sink more rapidly from moving water than the lighter materials it is found in. Dredging – The most important placer-mining method today this involves the use of a floating boat or barge with either a series of buckets to scoop gravel or a suctioning apparatus to vacuum gravel from the bottom of a creek or river.

## Hard Rock Mining vs. Placer Gold Mining
Hard rock or "Lode" gold is still contained within ore and various methods are used to extract the metal from the rock that surrounds it. Placer gold on the other hand occurs when natural erosion has released the gold from its host material and the gold is now a separate piece whether that be a small speck of gold dust or a large gold nugget.
