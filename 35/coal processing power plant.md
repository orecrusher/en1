## Coal
 · A coal-fired power station is an energy plant that burns coal – a fossil fuel – to generate electricity that's fed into the grid which supplies power to homes and businesses. There are a few key energies stored in coal and when successfully converted can create thermal energy mechanical energy and electrical energy.
