## copper processing 
 · Copper processing the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products.. In its pure form or as an alloy copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

Experimental testwork has shown that arsenic can be removed from arsenic-bearing solutions by hydrothermal precipitation at temperatures in the 170–200°C range. The presence of Fe(III) is required for combination with As(V) to form the crystalline hydrated ferric arsenate known as scorodite (FeAsO4·2H2O). The contained arsenic is effectively immobilized by incorporation into a crystalline

This would produce a metal product that contained little copper. Such a product would be cheaper to refine since refinery charges increase with increasing copper content in the metal.
