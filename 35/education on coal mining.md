Mining. Mining is the process of extracting coal oil and natural gas from the ground. Strip mining (also known as open cast mountaintop or surface mining) involves scraping away earth and rocks to get to coal buried near the surface (Greenpeace 2010). This often has significant impact on the surrounding land plants and animals.

## Coal mining 
The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures health and safety standards and worker eduion and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.
