 · The vertical roller mill uses the waste heat of the rotary kiln to dry the material in the mill. The process of the kiln system encounters sudden failures such as high-temperature fan tripping cyclone blockage or exhaust gas CO explosion etc. which will cause sudden vibration of the vertical roller mill. Although this phenomenon is rare the vibration caused by this is more harmful.
