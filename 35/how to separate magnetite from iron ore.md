## How is Iron Extracted from Iron Ore 
Iron is found naturally in the form of ores that are oxides of the pure metal such as hematite and magnetite. The most common of the modern methods used to extract iron from its ores is coke smelting in a blast furnace.

## Difference Between Magnetite and Hematite 
 · Magnetite and hematite can be separated from each other using their magnetic properties. Magnetite is ferromagnetic and hematite is paramagnetic. Therefore these substances can be separated using low-intensity magnetic separation method. Here an induced roll magnetic separator with a magnetic field with a 0.04 Tesla intensity is used.
