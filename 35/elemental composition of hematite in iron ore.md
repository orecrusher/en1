## Hematite 
Hematite (/ ˈ h iː m ə ˌ t aɪ t ˈ h ɛ m ə-/) also spelled as haematite is a common iron oxide compound with the formula Fe 2 O 3 and is widely found in rocks and soils. Hematite crystals belong to the rhombohedral lattice system which is designated the alpha polymorph of Fe 2 O 3.It has the same crystal structure as corundum (Al 2 O 3) and ilmenite (FeTiO 3).
