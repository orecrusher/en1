## COPPER Copper production 
Copper concentrators typically treat up to 100 000 t of ore per day. They are loed directly at the mines to achieve low transport costs. The copper recovery efficiency is over 90 %. About 95 % of the ore input goes into the tailings which are stored in large dams near the mine and are used for water recycling to the flotation stages.
