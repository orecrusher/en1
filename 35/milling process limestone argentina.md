## Lime in the Sugar Industry 
Lime in the Sugar Industry. Hydrated lime is essential to the production of sugar from both sugar cane and sugar beets. It is also used to purify sugar derived from other sources such as maple or sorghum. Sugar cane and sugar beets are harvested and processed with water to form raw juice which has low pH and contains dissolved impurities.

## Effect of milling mechanism on the CO2 capture performance 
 · This work analyzes the relevant influence of milling on the CO 2 capture performance of CaO derived from natural limestone. Diverse types of milling mechanisms produce contrasting effects on the microstructure of the CaO formed after calcination of the milled limestone samples which affects crucially the kinetics of carbonation at conditions for CO 2 capture.
