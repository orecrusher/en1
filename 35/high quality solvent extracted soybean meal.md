 · Oil extraction section: Use solvent (n-hexane) to extract the oil from soybeans and then get two kinds of products. One is wet meal with solvent the other is mixed oil (solvent and soybean oil). Desolventization section (DTDC System): The main equipment desolventizing-toasting-drying-cooling tower will separate the solvent from wet meal.
