## Concrete Pipe Versus Corrugated Metal Pipe 
 · The initial price of concrete culverts far exceeds the price of corrugated metal. However the higher initial price can be offset by longevity and in situations where a concrete pipe is specified for aesthetic reasons the higher initial price may be insignificant. The price of installation of pipes made of either material will be nearly identical.
