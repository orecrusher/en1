ABSTRACT The run of mine ore from Aghdarreh gold mine must be comminuted to achieve the desired degree of liberation of gold particles. Currently comminution circuits include a single-stage crushing using a jaw crusher and a single-stage grinding using a Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG) mill in closed circuit with a hydrocyclone package.
