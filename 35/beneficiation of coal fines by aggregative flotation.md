## The segregation behaviors of fine coal particles in a coal 
 · The segregation behaviors of fine coal particles in a coal beneficiation fluidized bed (CBFB) were investigated in this work. The size range of 1–8 mm was taken into account and three separate size fractions were studied comparatively in the experiments e.g. 1–2 mm 3–5.5 mm and 5.5–8 mm.Both a clean coal sample and a gangue sample were used as the processed material to study the

According to reports from plants operating for the production of metallurgi­cal coke each percent ash in the coal carries a penalty of 2$ per ton of coal.
