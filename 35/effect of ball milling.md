 · Ball milling time is crucial in obtaining a stable CB colloid as a long ball milling time is hypothesized to result in a lower CB structure. During ball milling butylamine will change the surface chemistry of CB and if there are sufficient charges at the CB surface repulsive forces among the CB particles is created.

## Effect of ball milling on the electroalytic activity of 
The effect of ball milling and the addition of carbon on the physico-chemical properties as well as the OER performance of the Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF) perovskite is investigated. We show that the ball milling process can significantly enhance the BSCF OER activity. This higher activity is associated with the formation of an amorphous surface layer produced during the ball milling process
