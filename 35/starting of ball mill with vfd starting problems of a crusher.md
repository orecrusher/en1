## Medium Voltage Drives 
Low voltage (LV) variable frequency drives (VFDs) have been applied to appliions up to 2500 horsepower (HP). Medium voltage (MV) VFDs have been applied to appliions as low as 150 HP. Traditional power system design practice suggests that motor crossover from low voltage to medium voltage is in the HP range.

## Overheating Electric Motors: A Major Cause of Failure 
 · Limiting the frequency of startup the most stressful portion of motor operation is highly important. Many well-documented cases of recurring motor failure were addressed by increasing the horsepower rating of the motor which shortened the time between failures. However the root cause of the failure was actually the frequency of starts and stops.
