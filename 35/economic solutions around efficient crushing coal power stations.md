 · Coal impacts: water pollution. When you burn charcoal in your grill at home ash is leftover. The same is true for coal-fired power plants which produce more than 100 million tons of coal ash every year. More than half of that waste ends up in ponds lakes landfills and other sites where over time it can contaminate waterways and drinking water supplies.

## Nuclear Power Economics 
The economics of any power generation depends primarily on what each unit (kWh MWh) costs to produce for the consumer who creates the demand for that power. This is the LCOE as outlined above. But secondly it depends on the market into which the power is sold where the producer and grid operator run into a raft of government policies often coupled with subsidies for other sources.
