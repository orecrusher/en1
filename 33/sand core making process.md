 · The most common type of core is a dry sand core. The basic process for making a dry sand core is by packing sand into a core box (essentially a mold) and then hardening it. The core is then supported in a mold by means of core prints or chaplets and the molten metal is poured into the mold creating the desired iron casting.

By eliminating the need for tool and mould making additive production processes shorten the manufacturing times of components by up to 75%. The 3D printing process allows them to be manufactured in a single compact production step. Sand molds and cores can be produced in just a few hours. That means a time saving of several weeks.

## Sand Core Making 
Cores are produced by blowing ramming or in heated processes investing sand into a core box. The finished cores which can be solid or hollow are inserted into the mold to provide the internal cavities of the casting before the mold halves are joined. Sand cores are also widely used in die-casting where permanent metal molds are employed.

## From Sand to Silicon 
Through a process called ion implantation (one form of a process called doping) the exposed areas of the silicon wafer are bombarded with various chemical impurities called Ions. Ions are implanted in the silicon wafer to alter the way silicon in these areas conducts electricity. Ions are shot onto the surface of the wafer at very high speed.
