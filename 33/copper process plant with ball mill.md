Processing. Ore is treated using a two-stage crushing process followed by a two-stage grinding circuit that consists of a semi-autogenous grinding mill and a ball mill. Most of the ground ore is fed to a gravity circuit that recovers about two-thirds of the gold which is then smelted on site to form doré bars.

The mine has a 40 ktpd plant that utilizes a conventional crushing grinding and flotation circuit to produce copper concentrates with gold and silver credits. A mill expansion to increase throughput to 45 ktpd with the installation of a third ball mill is currently underway and is expected to also improve recoveries resulting in increased production by 15 to 18%.
