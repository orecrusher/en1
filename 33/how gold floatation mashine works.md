## Artisanal and Small
Flotation is usually used by large scale miners but can also be applied in small scale operations. It is a process that works best for processing complex ore types especially ores that are difficult to process using gravity methods. In flotation a mixture of slurry (crushed ore and water) and frothing agents are added into a flotation machine.

 · Existing flotation machines work very well for sizes typically in the range of 50 to 150 μm. If the upper size limit for flotation could be increased by innovations in machine design there would be dramatic reductions in grinding energy which would lead to savings of great consequence for the running costs of the whole operation.
