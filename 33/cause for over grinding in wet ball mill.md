Ball Mills are the most effective laboratory mills for rapid batchwise comminution of medium-hard soft brittle fibrous temperature-sensitive and moist samples down to the finest particle size. The comminution of the material to be ground takes place through impact and friction between the grinding balls and the inside wall of the grinding bowl respectively the mortar.

## Kinetics of fine wet grinding in a laboratory ball mill 
 · Grinding was carried out in the laboratory ball mill described in Table 1 at a low ball load of 20% of the mill volume filled with the ball bed and a low powder load corresponding to a formal interstitial filling of void spaces of the ball bed of U=0.5. These conditions were chosen since it is known that they give first order grinding kinetics for normal grinding both dry and wet.

2. History of development and different mill designs Originally tumbling ball mills were often used for wet fine and ultrafine grinding. But since the power consumption of tumbling ball mills is limited by the number of revolutions at which the grinding media are centrifugated at the chamber wall the power density is relatively small.

The actual dispersion system in a bead mill consists of a milling chamber and an agitator; the milling chamber is filled with the grinding beads (material e.g. glass zircon oxide steel) and the product to be dispersed. In the milling vessel the grinding medium is kept moving by the agitator which itself is driven by a motor.
