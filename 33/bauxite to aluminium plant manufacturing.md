The aluminium production process can be broken down into three stages; first bauxites which contain aluminium are extracted from the ground. Second bauxites are processed into alumina or aluminium oxide and finally in stage three pure aluminium is produced using electrolytic reduction a process in which aluminium oxide is broken down into its components using electric current.
