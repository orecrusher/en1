## What is Compression Testing? 
Compression testing is one of the most fundamental types of mechanical testing alongside tensile and flexion tests. Compression tests are used to determine a material's behavior under applied crushing loads and are typically conducted by applying compressive pressure to a test specimen (usually of either a cuboid or cylindrical geometry) using platens or specialized fixtures on a universal

## Compressive Strength 
Compressive Strength. EPS is a closed cell lightweight and resilient foamed plastic composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The mechanical strength of EPS varies with its density. The most important mechanical property of EPS insulation and building products is its resistance to compressive stresses which increase as the density becomes higher.
