## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

 · Exploration is the process by which the accumulations of iron ore minerals can be found in the earth's crust. Before the heavy investments required to set up a mining operation is done the mining organization is to ensure that the deposit is economically viable and it has quantities of ore that will ensure ore production over a sufficiently long period of time.
