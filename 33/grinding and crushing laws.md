Impact crushers are traditionally classified to two main types: horizontal shaft impact (HSI) crushers and vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers. These different types of impact crushers share the crushing principle impact to reduce the material to smaller sizes but features capacities and optimal appliions are far from each other.

New Surface Formed by Grinding When a uniform particle is crushed after the first crushing the size of the particles produced will vary a great deal from relatively coarse to fine and even to dust. As the grinding continues the coarser particles will be further reduced but there will be less change in the size of the fine particles.
