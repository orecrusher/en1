## Does crushed stone need to be compacted? 
Crusher run (a mix of crushed stone and stone dust) is one of the best base materials for concrete flatwork. What is the compaction rate of gravel? If you are compacting road crush with a vibratory plate you will get about 10 to 15% compaction. (This is based on you having a stable compacted base first.

If thicker layers are used we recommend that each 12-inch thickness of stone backfill be densified by making 3 or 4 passes of a walk-behind vibratory sled or plate type compactor over the stone surface. Density testing is not performed.
