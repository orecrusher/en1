 · While flotation has a considerable capacity advantage over magnetic separation the real advantage of magnetic separation over flotation in fine iron ore beneficiation is that treatment of -10 µm iron ore is possible – in flotation the feed is deslimed at 10 µm and the -10 µm stream is considered to be final tailings even though there is often a significant amount of contained iron ore.

Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
