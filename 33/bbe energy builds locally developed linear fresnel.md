## Linear Fresnel reflectors 
 · Linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) systems produce a linear focus on a down­ward facing fixed receiver mounted on a series of small towers as shown in Fig. 1.3. Long rows of flat or slightly curved mirrors move independently on one axis to reflect the sun's rays onto the stationary receiver. For thermal 1.3 Linear Fresnel reflector: []

## Linear Fresnel Collector (LFC) solar thermal technology 
 · The first person in modern times to apply this principle in a reasonably large system for the solar collection was the Italian solar pioneer Giovanni Francia (Francia 1968) who developed both linear and two-axis tracking Fresnel collector systems and was thus the father of both LFC and central tower systems.Fig. 6.3 shows his first prototype array from 1961 built-in Marseille.
