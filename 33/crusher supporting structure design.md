## Best Practices for Adding Ribs and Gussets to 3D Printed 
When designing components that will be made of plastic it's often necessary to add ribs and gussets to improve the stiffness and strength of load bearing features. This reduces material volume and print time for 3D printed parts compared to the time it would take to make these features out of solid structures.
