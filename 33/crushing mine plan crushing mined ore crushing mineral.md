Crushing is an important step in the complex process of mineral processing (Fig. 1). In open pit mines rock chunks with edge lengths of 2 m have to be processed. In underground mines the biggest chunk sizes are about 0.5 m. Crushers have the task of reducing the ore rock to particle sizes in the millimetre range for subsequent grinding.
