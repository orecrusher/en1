## Mineral processing 
Multi-G processes allow the separation of very fine particles to occur (in the range of 5 to 50 micron) by increasing the driving force of separation in order to increase the rate at which particles separate. In general single G process are only capable of processing particles that are greater than approximately 80 micron in diameter.

Process Processing of the ore ranges from simple crushing and screening to a standard size through to processes that beneficiate or upgrade the quality of the iron ore products. This is done by physical processes which remove impurities by differences in particle density or size gravity or size separation. Processing may be wet or dry.

In the DRI process iron ore in the form of lump or pellets is reduced to metallic iron in the solid state unlike in the BF where the material is melted. Today about 100 Mt of DRI is produced globally each year with the majority of that using reformed natural gas (essentially splitting natural gas into hydrogen and carbon monoxide) to strip away the oxygen from the iron ore.
