## Limestone—A Crucial and Versatile Industrial Mineral Commodity
Some Issues in Limestone Mining. Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However underground limestonemines are found at places in the central and eastern United States especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime - stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.
