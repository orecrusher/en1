As value shifted from refining to upstream production it became even more essential for refineries to increase high-value fuel yield from a variety of crudes. From 10-40% gasoline for crude a century ago a modern refinery can get up to 70% gasoline from the same quality crude through a variety of advanced reforming and cracking processes.

## Gold Refining 
 · The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold. The Miller process is rapid and simple but it

## How to Take the Impurities out of Gold 
Put the crucible in a furnace. Heat to 1100 degrees Celsius. Dross will rise to the surface. Periodically remove the crucible from the furnace and skim the impurities off the surface of the molten gold. Stir the gold after each removal of dross and before returning it to the furnace. Repeat this process until dross stops rising to the surface.

## The Corn Refining Process
The Corn Refining Process or more than 150 years corn refiners have been perfecting the process of separating corn into its component parts to create a myriad of value added products. The corn wet milling process separates corn into its four basic components: starch germ fiber and protein. There are five basic steps to accomplish this process.
