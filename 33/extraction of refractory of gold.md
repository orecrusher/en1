## Simultaneous removal of S and As from a refractory gold 
S and As are common impurities in refractory gold ores and must be removed before gold extraction. Thermodynamic analyses show that it is possible to simultaneously remove S and As by an O-2-enriched single-stage roasting which is confirmed with experimental results from roasting of a gold refractory ore. The range of optimal O-2 requirement is narrow and varies with the S and As content in

At present the main refractory gold processing methods include ultrafine grinding pressure oxidation (POX) roasting or bioleaching. Pressure oxidation roasting and bioleaching have been successful in oxidising refractory sulphide minerals to expose gold in solid solution that cannot be recovered by ultra-fine grinding alone.

 · Ammoniacal thiosulfate was used for gold extraction from the biooxidation residue of the refractory gold concentrate. The results showed that the optimal reagent conditions were 0.18 M thiosulfate 0.02 M copper (II) 1.0 M ammonia and 0.24 M sulfite. Under these conditions a maximum gold leaching efficiency of 85.05% was obtained.

Abstract: The amenability of a refractory ore to the extraction of gold and silver by cyanide leaching was investigated. Diagnostic leaching tests were also performed to shed light on the refractory characteristics of ore. The leaching tests show that the extraction of gold and silver is consistently low i.e. ≤47% and ≤19.2% respectively over a leaching period of 24 h.

## Extraction of gold from an Indian low
The work carried out on the processing of a low-grade and refractory gold ore using thiourea is presented. Direct leaching of the "as-received" ore with thiourea has yielded only 16% gold extraction. Starting with ore containing 14 g/t of gold it has been possible to generate a sulphide concentrate with 6.1 g/t of gold by physical beneficiation of the ore through froth flotation.

## Optimising extractive metallurgy of refractory gold 
 · Gold tellurides are refractory gold ores and the extraction of gold from gold tellurides is becoming increasingly important as a result of the world's continued high demand of gold and the exhaustion of free-milling gold ores. Australia is the world's second largest gold producer and hosts a large portion of gold tellurides ore deposits.

## Refractory and Non
Refractory and Non-Refractory Ore. In general refractory ore is one that is not amenable to gold extraction using cyanide. Refractory ore is undesirable because the methods needed to enable gold extraction are expensive. Non-refractory ore is where cyanide can be used to extract the gold. This is desirable as it means the process will be cheaper.
