## Threading (manufacturing) 
Threading is the process of creating a screw thread.More screw threads are produced each year than any other machine element. There are many methods of generating threads including subtractive methods (many kinds of thread cutting and grinding as detailed below); deformative or transformative methods (rolling and forming; molding and casting); additive methods (such as 3D printing); or
