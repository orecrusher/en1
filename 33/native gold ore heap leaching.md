## Acid Heap Leaching Of Gold Ores 
Acid Heap Leaching Of Gold Ores. A method for recovering metal values from large deposits of low grade ores or from high grade ore existing in small ore bodies in an outdoor operation near the mine which comprises making a pile of the ore and successively leaching selected depths of the ore from the top of the pile down by adding leaching agent and sufficient moisture to leach the metal

## How does the Cyanide heap leaching process work and what 
 · The crushed ore is placed in large piles called heaps and sprayed with cyanide solution. The cyanide solution trickles down through the pile of crushed ore and dissolves the tiny gold particles away from the surrounding ore. The cyanide gold solution is collected at the bottom of the heap by a synthetic liner and sent to the mill.

Cyanide extraction of gold through milling of high-grade ores and heap leaching of low-grade ores requires cycling of millions of liters of alkaline water containing high concentrations of potentially toxic sodium cyanide (NaCN) free cyanide and metal-cyanide complexes. Some milling operations result in tailings ponds of 150 ha and larger.

Most open-pit gold mining operations around the world use a heap leaching to extract ores from these types of deposits. Consider that most of the largest gold mines in the world are mining what would be

gold-bearing ore with hydrogen peroxide during heap leaching of gold increases gold recovery by 1.2% and amounts to 55.89% without treatment - 54.69%. This increases the consumption of sodium cyanide by 0.04 kg/t. Keywords: heap leaching gold heap leaching intensifiion gold leaching hydrogen peroxide oxidizer gold.

Gold processing. With ores of higher gold content (ie greater than 20 grams of gold per ton of ore) cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent for several hours in large tanks equipped with agitators For extracting gold from low-grade ores heap leaching is practiced.

The heap leaching process being employed at Lomati Mine is a commonly used process to extract gold from the ore. Generally the ore is crushed into fine particles before being heaped and sprayed with a leaching solution which liquefies and separates the gold from the ore.

HEAP LEACHING. Heap leaching was introduced in the 1970's as a means to drastically reduce gold recovery costs. This process has literally made many mines by taking low grade geological resources and transforming them to the proven ore egory. Ore grades as low as 0.01 oz Au per ton have been economically processed by heap leaching.
