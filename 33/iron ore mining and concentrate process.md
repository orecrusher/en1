## iron ore mining and concentrate process
The ore dressing production process is to convert the mined iron ore material into the iron ore concentrate. Also in order to meet the demand of different ore concentrate products from back-end customers in the supply chain the front-end mining production and mineral processing/dressing production should be coordinated.

## Iron Concentrate 
 · Iron Concentrate is created by purifying Crushed Iron Ore. This can be done in one of two ways either dry og wet purifiion. Each of the metodes to purify the iron has two specific crafting stations that can do the job. The crafting stations come with different ratios labor cost and time cost. The process to make Iron Concentrate also gives a byproduct of either Tailings or Wet Tailings

Iron pellets Pellets are obtained during the pelletizing process from iron ore concentrate. Iron pellets are porous pellets of 6 to 25 mm which often have a purity of 64 to 66 percent. The reason for pelletizing iron concentrate is the powder form and fine granulation of concentrate which makes it possible to use it directly in the furnace.

The iron ore deposit at Lisakovsk North Kazakhstan is a limonitic one of oolitic type and the major iron minerals are goethite and about 0.5 % magnetite. The gangue minerals are predominantly quartz and clay like minerals such as carbonates chlorite and other aluminosilies as reported in a comparative study by Kosava et all.

## Why preconcentrate and how? 
 · Preconcentration effectively upgrades the plant feed; fewer tonnes of ore are treated in the processing plant per tonne of product thus reducing the costs energy and water consumption per tonne of product. If conducted as close as possible to the mining face it can also significantly reduce ore transport requirements.
