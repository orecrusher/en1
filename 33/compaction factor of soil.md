## Soil compaction effects on soil health and 
 · Soil compaction causes substantial reduction in agriculture productivity and has always been of great distress for farmers. Intensive agriculture seems to be more crucial in causing compaction. High mechanical load less crop diversifiion intensive grazing and irrigation methods lead to soil compaction. It is further exasperated when these factors are accompanied with low organic matter

## Effects of Soil Compaction 
 · Soil compaction destroys soil structure and leads to a more massive soil structure with fewer natural voids (Figure 11). In a pasture soil (similar to a no-till soil that has not been tilled for a long time) the soil structure is very well developed due to effects of increased organic matter and the fine root systems of grasses.

LESSON 15. Factors Affecting Compaction. Water content: Water content has significant effect on compaction characteristics of soil. At low water content soil is stiff and soil grains offer more resistance to compaction. As the water content increases water films are formed around the soil grains and water around the soil grains act as lubricant.

## Soil Compaction : Mechanics Factors Affecting Compaction 
 · Soil Compaction is a method of stabilizing loose soil by densifiion which can be achieved with either static or dynamic load. At constant water content the process requires a permanent reduction in the amount of air voids.. The most popular and least costly form of soil improvement method is compaction of soil. It improves the soil's shear strength and thus its stability and bearing

Lift height (depth of the soil layer) is an important factor that affects machine performance and compaction cost. Vibratory and rammer-type equipment compact soil in the same direction: from top to bottom and bottom to top. As the machine hits the soil the impact travels to the hard surface below and then returns upward. This sets all particles in motion and compaction takes place.
