## Color In Flowers – Where Does Flower Pigment Come From
 · The pigments that produce color in plants ultimately come from genes and DNA. A plant's genes dictate which pigments are produced in which cells and what amounts. Flower color genetics can be manipulated and has been by people. When plants are selectively bred for certain colors plant genetics that direct pigment production are being used.

 · The organic pigments and inorganic pigments can be based on three principle factors. Inorganic pigment has high-quality primary pigment to deliver uniform colour shade. so carbon chains can be right always to present in molecules of the organic pigments. And each element can be associated with nitrogen and sulphur elements of the same class atomic tables.
