## Iron ore 
Iron makes up close to 5% of the Earth's crust. It takes around 1.6 tons of iron ore to produce one ton of steel. The chemical symbol for iron is 'Fe' because of its Latin name Ferrum. We use 20 times more iron (in the form of steel) than all other metals put together. Our iron ore trains are over 2.5km (264 ore cars) long meaning it can take

Extraction of Iron Concentration of Ore - An Overview. Sep 23 2019 · The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.

 · Iron formation consists of iron ore such as siderite magnetite and hematite with silica in the form of chert jasper etc. generally in bands but sometimes not distinctly so. The bands of iron ore are at times high-grade but are often mixed with a good deal of silica the whole making an ore too lean for use without concentration.
