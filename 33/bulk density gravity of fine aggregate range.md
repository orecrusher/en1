## Determination of bulk density of aggregates – Seismic 
 · For a coarse aggregate a higher bulk density means that there are few voids which are to be filled by the fine aggregate and cement. Thus bulk density also depends upon the degree of packing. Procedure: Note down the dimensions and empty weight of the measuring container and compute its volume.

Aggregate definition and Shape Types Properties. Aggregates occupy 70 to 80% of the volume of concrete. Physical characteristics and in some cases the chemical composition of aggregates affect the properties of concrete in its plastic and hardened state. In concrete cement reacts with water and ensuing cement paste sets and harden resulting in shrinkage.
