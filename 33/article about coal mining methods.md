Using gangue backfilling in underground coal mining not only controls the roof deformation in the gob area but also reduces the amount of mining waste rock. However due to the limitations of the complied engineering conditions backfilling mining in the steep coal seam is not widely applied.

## Impact of Coal Mining on Environment: A Study of Raniganj 
 · Coal is mainly mined using two methods – surface or "opencast" and underground mining. The geological condition determines the method of mining. Coal mining is usually associated with the degradation of natural resources and the destruction of habitat. This causes invasive species to occupy the area thus posing a threat to biodiversity.

## Coal mining 
Coal mining takes place either underground or through surface/ opencast operations. The method used depends on the geology of the coal deposit. When is this used? Surface mining is used when the coal seam is near the surface. It recovers a higher proportion of the coal deposit than underground mining as all coal seams are exploited – 90% or

## Respiratory Diseases Caused by Coal Mine Dust
 · Coal is an important global commodity and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Thus mining of coal will also remain important. Despite improvements in exposure assessment and ventilation controls and the existence of protective government regulations coal miners are still at risk for respiratory diseases caused by coal mine dust and their associated morbidity and mortality.
