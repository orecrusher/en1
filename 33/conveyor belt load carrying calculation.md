Belt tension: The belt of the conveyor always experience a tensile load due to the rotation of the electric drive weight of the conveyed materials and due to the idlers. The belt tension at steady state can be calculated as:Tb = 1.37fLg[2mi+ (2mb + mm)cos ()] + (Hgmm).eqn.1.1 WhereTb is in Newton.f = Coefficient of frictionL = Conveyor length in meters.

## Belt Conveyor Load Calculations 
 · When carrying out belt conveyor load calculation the total payload on the belt conveyor as well as the area the load will take up on the conveyor need to be considered. Most belt conveyors are designed with the belt being dragged over a stainless steel deck. This causes friction between the belt and the deck.

Belt tension: The belt of the conveyor always experience a tensile load due to the rotation of the electric drive weight of the conveyed materials and due to the idlers. The belt tension at steady state can be calculated as:Tb = 1.37fLg[2mi+ (2mb + mm)cos (δ)] + (Hgmm).eqn.1.1 WhereTb is in Newton.f = Coefficient of frictionL = Conveyor length in meters.
