## ACOUSTIC EMISSION 
Acoustic Emission (AE) is the phenomenon of radiation of acoustic (elastic) waves in solids as a result of damage or irreversible change to the internal structure of the material. Although the name itself suggests an audible signal this is misleading because the range of frequencies involved is between 50Khz and up to 1Mhz practically ultrasonic frequencies.

## What Is Acoustic Emission Testing? A Definitive Guide 
Acoustic emission testing works by mounting small sensors onto a component under test. The sensors convert the stress waves into electrical signals which are relayed to an acquisition PC for processing. The waves are captured when the component is submitted to an external stimulus such as high pressures loads or temperatures.

 · Acoustic Emission (AE) refers to the generation of transient elastic waves produced by a sudden redistribution of stress in a material. When a structure is subjected to an external stimulus (change in pressure load or temperature) localized sources trigger the release of energy in the form of stress waves which propagate to the surface and are recorded by sensors.

In the case of discrete-type acoustic emission the main parameters called descriptors are calculated in real time by the system or in post-processing from the digitized waveforms.

## Acoustic Emission 
Acoustic emission (AE) is defined as 'transient elastic stress waves produced by a release of energy from a localized source' (Weng et al. 1982 ). An AE sensor composed of a thick piezoelectric element shown in Fig. 4.15a converts the mechanical energy caused by elastic waves into an electrical signal.

## Acoustic emission 
Acoustic emission (AE) is the phenomenon of radiation of acoustic (elastic) waves in solids that occurs when a material undergoes irreversible changes in its internal structure for example as a result of crack formation or plastic deformation due to aging temperature gradients or external mechanical forces.In particular AE is occurring during the processes of mechanical loading of materials
