## How is flour made? What is plain flour? Is white flour 
Wholemeal or wholegrain flour as the name suggests uses all of the grain. And brown flour uses around 85% of the grain. See here for more information on some of the different types of flour available. This short video is designed to show the transformation of the wheat seed into flour and also the relevant machinery within a modern flour mill.

## How Do Grain Windmills Work? 
 · Since ancient times windmills have been used primarily as a method of grinding grain into flour by using the power of the wind. The original windmills used in Persia in the 9th century were vertical-axis mills but modern windmills use a horizontal axis in which the blades are fixed to a central post which is more efficient.

## Geography Landscape and Mills 
For flour and grist mills this meant the grain had to be relatively close at hand to the mill with a nearby market for flour. Other uses of mills — to saw wood to full cloth and later to pulp rags for paper among them —also had certain requirements that conditioned the placement of mills in the landscape.
