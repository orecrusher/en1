## Maintaining Your Attrition Mill 
Attrition Mills provide high-intensity scrubbing to remove coatings and stains from sand feeds and to disintegrate lignite. Two five-bladed propellers per shaft force the sand grains to grind against each other. This provides the scrubbing action needed to remove those coatings and stains and gives direction of movement to the material allowing it to travel from cell to cell inside the machine.

In this regard the technologies of impact and attrition milling have been compared by several studies. Although energy consumption is of major concern the product properties or the behaviour of the components within the mixture may vary depending on the mechanism chosen. Such investigation is still missing for the dry stirred media milling.
