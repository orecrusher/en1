## Phosphate mineral 
Phosphate minerals contain the tetrahedrally coordinated phosphate (PO 4 3−) anion along sometimes with arsenate (AsO 4 3−) and vanadate (VO 4 3−) substitutions and chloride (Cl −) fluoride (F −) and hydroxide (OH −) anions that also fit into the crystal structure.. The phosphate class of minerals is a large and diverse group however only a few species are relatively common.
