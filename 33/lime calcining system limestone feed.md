## Lime kiln 
A lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce the form of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide).The chemical equation for this reaction isCaCO 3 + heat → CaO + CO 2. This reaction can take place at anywhere above 840 °C (1544 °F) but is generally considered to occur at 900 °C(1655 °F) (at which temperature the partial pressure of CO 2 is 1

Pebble lime calcining is a process by which carbonates of calcium and magnesium (CaCO3 and MgCO3) or limestone collectively are heated to temperatures high enough to drive off CO2 and produce oxides of calcium and magnesium (CaO and MgO) lime product.

## What is Calcining? (with pictures) 
Calcining may be used by recycling facilities to recycle metal waste products. Originally the word calcining was used to refer to processes that involved calcium as when limestone is turned into lime. However the term is also used to describe similar processes using similar temperatures and equipment that do not involve calcium.

## Lime Kiln 
A lime kiln is used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce quicklime also called burnt lime. Usually the heat is around 900 Degree Celsius but a temperature around 1000 Degree Celsius is used to make the calcination process more quickly. Excessive temperature is discouraged because it produces "dead-burned" lime which is unreactive.
