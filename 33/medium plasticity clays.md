The sand is sub-divided as Coarse Sand (4.75 mm to 2.0 mm) Medium Sand (2.0 mm to 0.425 mm) and Fine Sand (0.425 mm to 0.075 mm). Soil with particle size less than 0.075 mm is called Fine-Grained soil (Silt or Clay) and soil with particle size in between 80 mm to 0.075 mm is called Coarse-Grained soil.

## Plasticity of Soil 
Plasticity of Soil It is the property of soil by which it undergoes deformation without cracking or fracturing. Criteria: i. The soil should be clay. ii. Presence of water Negative charges are present on the surfaces of clay particles. The water molecules are dipolar and hence they are attracted towards the surfaces of clay

## Plasticity of Clays (Die Plastizitaet der Tone)
The flow limit and plastic limit are the actual plasticity limits of clays. The difference between the data for the flow limit and plastic limit i.e. the plasticity number is the best measure of the degree of plasticity. According to the varying level of the plasticity numbers the clays can be grouped into three or four plasticity classes.

chemical composition clays exhibit cohesion and plasticity. Clays can be classified as stiff medium or soft depending on the moisture content with drier clays typically being stiffer. Clays make a satisfactory bearing material under some condi-tions. Long-term settlement can sometimes control the allow-able bearing pressure.

## Soil classifiion 
Clay minerals are produced mainly from the chemical weathering and decomposition of feldspars such as orthoclase and plagioclase and some micas. They are small in size and very flaky in shape. The key to some of the properties of clay soils e.g. plasticity compressibility swelling/shrinkage potential lies in the structure of clay minerals.
