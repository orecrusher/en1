If employed effectively concentration methods can eliminate or greatly reduce the need for mercury. Before concentration can begin ore must be crushed or milled to liberate gold particles from rock and to decrease grain size.

## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining 
Heap leaching: In the open cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap. The pad collects the now metal-impregnated solution which is stripped of gold and resprayed on the heap until the ore is depleted.

This oxidation process will make copper oxide zinc oxide and lead oxide — all of which are less dense than pure gold and will float to the top of your crucible allowing the slag to be sloughed off.

## The process design of gold leaching and carbon
The ore is first reduced in size (typically 80% passing 75µm) to ensure that all non-refractory gold is readily accessible for cyanide leaching. There are several variations of comminution circuits used in the gold industry such as: Multi-stage crushing and pebble and/or ball milling circuits typical of

## Stamp mill 
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps loosely held vertically in a frame in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp the stamp falls onto the ore below crushing the rock and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.
