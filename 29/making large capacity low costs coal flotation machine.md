## Wind Turbine Cost: Worth The Million
 · The Breakdown of Initial Wind Turbine Costs. $2.6 – $4 million per average-sized commercial wind turbine. Typical cost is $1.3 million per megawatt (MW) of electricity-producing capacity. Most commercial wind turbines have a capacity of 2-3 MW but offshore turbines can be as large as 12 MW. Cost increases as turbine size increases though

## Read "The Hydrogen Economy: Opportunities Costs Barriers 
The lowest-cost hydrogen coal plants are likely to be ones that coproduce power and hydrogen. 2. Coal is a viable option for making hydrogen in very large centralized plants when the demand for hydrogen becomes large enough to support an associated very large distribution system.

## Flotation Bank 
Where the coal seam does not contain significant amounts of ultrafine clay conventional flotation may be competitive and the benefits of column flotation minimized. Also the presence of existing thermal drying capacity makes a by-zero circuit much more attractive since thermal drying overcomes the very high incremental moisture associated with ultrafine solids.
