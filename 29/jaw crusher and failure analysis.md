## Theoretical Analysis of Swing Jaw Plates used in Heat 
A jaw crusher breaks minerals ores of high strength. The stiffness of swing jaw plate has not been varied with changes in rock strength. Thus stiffness of swing plate is enough to crush taconite with an unconfined compressive strength (Q U ) of up to 308 MPa may be over signed for softer fragmental. Hence the weight of the swing plate is necessary to reduced.
