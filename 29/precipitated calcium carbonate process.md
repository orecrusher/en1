## Precipitated Calcium Carbonate Manufacturer
Activated Calcium Carbonate is produced by surface coating the Precipitated Calcium Carbonate slurry with Fatty Acids (Stearic Acid) and Titanate Coupling Agent. Filtering and drying of the coated PCC slurry to produce ACC Powder. The particle size as well as the crystal form is controlled by temperature concentration of reactants and time.

## Performance of Separation Processes for Precipitated 
 · In this work experiments were performed to determine the filterability of calcium carbonate produced with an alternative calcium carbonate production concept. The concept uses steelmaking slag as raw material and has potential to fix CO2 emissions and utilize steelmaking slag simultaneously. As calcium carbonate is precipitated in a solution containing ammonium chloride calcium
