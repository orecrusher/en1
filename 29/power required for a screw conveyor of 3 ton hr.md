## Types of Conveyors in a Thermal Power Plant
 · A thermal power plant converts heat energy to electricity from heat sources such as steam and fossil fuels. Thermal power plants rely on conveyor transfer systems to transport coal and in some cases ash from the unloading point to the designated storage site. Depending on the site of the power plant and load capacity you may need to employ one or multiple transfer systems.

 · A screw that has a constant pitch and diameter (and a constant shaft diameter) will give rise to the formation of a flow channel at the back of the hopper over the first flight of the screw. As shown in Figure 13 this channel will draw material from the top surface into the flow channel until a stable rathole forms and the channel empties.
