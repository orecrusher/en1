 · Coal preparation (beneficiation) is the stage in coal production when the mined coal is processed into a range of clean graded and uniform coal products that are suitable for the commercial market. The pulverization of bulk coal samples from the field serves both to homogenize the coal which typically is quite heterogeneous and to reduce the material to small particles needed for analysis.
