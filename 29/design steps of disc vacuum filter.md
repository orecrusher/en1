 · The pressure drop is typically less than 5 psi and should be dictated by the vacuum rating for the tank or rupture disk vacuum rating. Clearly it is important to avoid pulling a strong vacuum on the tank that might cause collapse. Calculate the number of filters or filter area required to meet flow rate and pressure drop requirements.
