Profile milling covers multi-axis milling of convex and concave shapes in two and three dimensions. The larger the component and the more complied the configuration to the machine the more important the profile milling process planning becomes. The machining process should be divided into at least three operation types: Roughing/semi-roughing.

## Which is better: dry or wet machining? 
 · When near-dry milling with MQL the tool's cutting edge works inside a mist formed from oil and compressed air which is sprayed directly into the cutting zone. Depending on the design of a machine tool and milling cutter the mist is delivered externally or internally through the cutter. The main function of MQL is to lubrie the cutting edge.

## Milling Machine: Methods of Milling. Milling Processes 
 · Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed the overall removal is quite brisk.
