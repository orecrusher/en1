However mining activities on large scale are confined mainly to a few minerals - Heavy Mineral Sands China Clay and to a lesser extent Limestone/Limeshell Silica Sand and Granite. In fact Heavy mineral sand and China Clay contribute more than 90% of the total value of mineral production in the State.

## Is Limestone a element or compound? 
 · Limestone is calcium carbonate which generally accumulates from large formations of marine animals with shells (made of calcium carbonate). It is an inorganic chemical compound which is ionic in nature made up of a calcium 2+ ion and carbonate (CO3 2-) anion.

Limestone is more porous than marble because there are small openings between the fossil fragments. Marble is usually light colored and is composed of crystals of calcite locked together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Marble may contain colored streaks that are inclusions of non-calcite minerals.

## What is the Difference between Dolomite and Limestone 
dolomite-and-limestone. Limestone –. Limestone is a carbonate which is found at the upper rock layers of the earth. The carbonate rocks of the sedimentary layer are called limestones. About 10% of the rocks in the sedimentary layer are limestones. Limestone has many uses it is used in toothpaste it is used in paints as a soil conditioner etc.

## Uses of Limestone 
Limestone rock is a sedimentary rock which forms in the process of sedimentation at the bottom of lakes and oceans or in caves. It is mainly composed of mineral calcite and aragonite both of which are crystal forms of calcium carbonate. A limestone with 95 percent or more of calcium carbonate by weight is known as a high-calcium limestone.
