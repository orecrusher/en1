Coal Crushing and Grinding Our Company procures coal from indigenous sources. In addition we also use coal that is imported from Australia Indonesia and South Africa. They are then blended together to achieve a uniform heat value. The coal mixture is then crushed and ground in a ball mill up to 75 microns in size and stored in fine coal hoppers.

Coal Mill Cement Equipment In Cement Plant Agico The coal mill grinding system is an important part of the dry process cement manufacturing. In cement plants we usually adopt the air swept coal mill system or vertical mill system as the pulverized coal preparation system which is arranged at the cement kiln head or kiln tail to provide fuel for clinker calcination.

## The Cement Manufacturing Process 
The cement manufacturing process starts with the mining of limestone that is excavated from open cast mines. Then this limestone is crushed to -80 mm size and is loaded in longitudinal stockpiles. Limestone is taken out diagonally from these stockpiles for grinding in raw mill hoppers. As mentioned earlier coal is used as a fuel to heat the raw

Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica-bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silies.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.
