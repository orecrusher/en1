## Magnetite: South Australia's potential
Magnetite ore has a prolonged history of use as a source of iron ore in particular in historically important iron and steel producing countries such as the USA Canada Russia Sweden and China. Magnetite ores require varying degrees of processing and beneficiation to produce an iron ore suitable for steelmaking purposes ultimately contributing to higher production costs.
