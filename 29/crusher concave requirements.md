## Crushers and Their Types – IspatGuru
 · Cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks material by squeezing the material between an eccentrically gyrating spindle which is covered by a wear resistant mantle and the enclosing concave hopper covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner.

The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber – it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.
