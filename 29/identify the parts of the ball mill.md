## Minimizing the cost of CNC parts (13 proven design tips 
All CNC milling tools have a cylindrical shape and will create a radius when cutting the edge of a pocket. Corner radius can be reduced by using a tool with a smaller diameter. This means that multiple passes at a lower speed will be required - a smaller tool cannot remove material in one pass as fast as a larger tool - increasing the machining time and cost.
