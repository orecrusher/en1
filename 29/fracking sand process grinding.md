## What is frac sand? 
Frac sand is a type of sand with small uniform particles. It is injected into the rock formation along with the water used to fracture the rock in the process known as hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"). The sand is used to prop open the fractures that are created. Because the particles are uniform fluids like water oil and gas are able to flow through the spaces between

## Frac Sand Health and Environmental Impacts 
Sand is critical to fracking. After workers drill down into rock they create fractures by pumping in a mixture of water chemicals and sand. The sand keeps the cracks propped open so that oil and gas are released. Frac sand mining creates significant air pollution from the handling mining and processing of the sand.

## What is hydraulic fracturing? 
Hydraulic fracturing informally referred to as "fracking" is an oil and gas well development process that typically involves injecting water sand and chemicals under high pressure into a bedrock formation via the well. This process is intended to create new fractures in the rock as well as increase the size extent and connectivity of existing fractures.
