## Mineral processing 
Mineral processing art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.

## The basics of crushing : Pit Quarry
 · No matter where an operation is loed or what geologic material is available the goal is always the same: produce required aggregate sizes at the lowest cost per ton. To do that an operation must be organized and efficient especially when it comes to the crushing process. Crushing is at the heart of every aggregate operation.
