Beneficiation and mineral processing of bauxite and feldspar. Bauxite is a sedimentary rock that is rich in alumina the base for making aluminum. It is generally easy to mine because it is found near the surface of terrain. However the process for separating the alumina from the other base elements in bauxite can be environmentally unfriendly.

## Bauxite 
However some bauxites require some form of screening (either wet or dry) to remove the fine grained material to improve the grade and/or handleability. These deposits usually have a beneficiation plant that washes the bauxite and sends the high silica fines (kaolinite and/or quartz) to a tailings dam prior to ship loading the bauxite.
