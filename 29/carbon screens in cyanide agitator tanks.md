## Inclined separation screen for agitation tank 
Because of the rapid abrasion of carbon by vibrating screens fixed peripheral screens have been mounted on the upper rim of the agitated tanks. Such screens now in use are vertical but because the flow of pulp holds the larger carbon particles against the screens thus "blinding" them air jets are typically used to remove the carbon particles and keep the screen open to the flow of pulp.

## DYNAMIC SIMULATION OF THE CARBON
activated carbon has been the dominant process for gold extraction after leaching by cyanide in aerated alkaline slurries. The continuous processes of gold recovery by adsorption on activated carbon in agitated tanks namely the carbon-in-pulp (CIP) and the carbon-in-leach (CIL) processes have been widely used since the 1970s. Due to the economic
