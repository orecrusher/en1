## Different Types of Servo Motors and How Do They Work With 
AC Servo Motor. This motor includes encoder which is used with controllers for giving closed loop control and also feedback. This motor can be employed to high accuracy and also controlled exactly as required for the appliions. Often these motors have advanced designs of easiness or better bearings and some simple designs also use higher voltages in order to achieve greater torque.

## Two Phase AC Servo Motor 
Here I am going to discuss the Two Phase and Three Phase AC Servo motor. The stator of the Two Phase AC Servo Motor has the two distributed windings which are displaced from each other by 90 degrees electrical. One winding is known as a Reference or Fixed Phase which is supplied from a constant voltage source.

## Servo Motor SG
 · Most of the hobby Servo motors operates from 4.8V to 6.5V the higher the voltage higher the torque we can achieve but most commonly they are operated at +5V. Almost all hobby servo motors can rotate only from 0° to 180° due to their gear arrangement so make sure you project can live with the half circle if no you can prefer for a 0° to 360° motor or modify the motor to make a full circle.
