Traditionally precious stones were the Big Four gemstones — diamonds emeralds rubies and sapphires. Semi-precious stones were everything else.

## Color
 · Keep the color-coding plan simple. Plans work best with 3-5 colors in most small-to-medium plants. Secondary methods of color-coding such as using a broom that's one color with a different colored handle usually confuse workers and aren't nearly as effective as a total-color system. Be consistent with colors.
