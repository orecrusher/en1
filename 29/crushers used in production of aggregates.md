## 1. Introduction 
 · Natural sand gravel and crushed rock aggregates are fundamental to the man-made environment and represent a large proportion of the materials used in the construction industry. Re-use of aggregates has become a more common practice and the substitution of natural aggregates by artificial aggregates made from waste products of other industries is a small part of the industry.

## Crusher 
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks gravel sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size or change the form of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore) so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

Crushed stone plays a vital role in the production of concrete and asphalt types. It is also largely used in the construction of building foundations drainage systems and roads. As crushed stones have jagged and angled edges they provide a larger surface area for bonding of sand water and other components of ready-mix concrete and thus hold the dominant share of the market
