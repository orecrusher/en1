## Block Caving – A Viable Alternative? 
Block cave mining is an underground mass mining method that allows for the bulk extraction of large relatively lower grade ore deposits with substantial vertical dimension. In block caving a large section of ore is initially undercut by drilling and blasting creating a large unsupported roof that will start to collapse under its own weight and instability.

## Techniques in Underground Mining 
Properly applied block-caving is a low-cost productive mass mining method. However the amenability of a rock mass to caving is not always predictable. Also the comprehensive development that is required results in a long lead-time before the mine starts producing: the delay in earnings can have a negative influence on the financial projections used to justify the investment.
