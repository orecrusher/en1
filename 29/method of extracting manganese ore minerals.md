## extracting and refinering methods for manganese
For example almost half of the manganese ore resources in India are ferruginous and more than 73% of the manganese ores in China belong to Fe-Mn ores with a low Mn/Fe mass ratio (3). With the depletion of high grade manganese ore resources the Fe-Mn ores are becoming important substitution resources for extracting manganese.

## Mining Methods • Environment Guide
Mining Methods. There are four key stages of work involved in mining for minerals. These include: 3415 3416 Prospecting – The purpose of this stage is to identify areas that are likely to contain mineral deposits. The work includes geological geochemical and geophysical surveys (e.g. seismic surveying) aerial surveys including the taking of samples by low-impact mechanical methods.

## Manganese Mining and Extraction 
When the ore is mined it is sent for electrolytic processing or smelting. Freeing manganese from the open pit rock bed requires a lot of manpower and time. As you know in this method the open pit mining using the standardised equipment and methods for overburden are removed to extract the manganese ore.

## Ores and Minerals 
First ores are crushed and grinded and then gauge or matrix is removed from the powdered ore. This is called concentration of ores. Ores of highly moderately and low reactive metals are 1 st concentrated. This step is common for ores of all types of metals. It is carried out by various methods depending upon the nature of the ore.
