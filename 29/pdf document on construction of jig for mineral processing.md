## Jigs and Fixture : Working advantages and Differences 
 · We know that machining is the process of removing metal by the moving or stationary work piece by use of tool. This process is done on some kind of machining like lathe milling drilling etc. When the work piece is smaller and simpler it can be easily mounted on the machine and we do not require any other mechanism to hold the work piece (concept of Fixture) and guide the tool (concept of Jigs).
