## Carbon in pulp 
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial appliions where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.

## Estimating process design gold extraction leach residence 
 · Plant design parameters for gold extraction leach residence time and cyanide consumption are generally determined from standard bench-scale bottle roll or agitation leach tests. The appliion of laboratory data to process design has essentially evolved from the testing of oxide or low cyanide-consuming ores. Such scale-up factors may not be appropriate for ores that deplete cyanide
