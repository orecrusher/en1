What we do. Since 1996 we solve problems around fluids mainly water treatment. This we do in the industry in big and small buildings and private homes with our Merus Ring. The key word "solving" can be taken in the literal sense. In most cases it is not the water causing problems.

If i have a power of 11.5 kW and voltage of 400V what size circuit breaker is needed for three-phase system. My calculation was 11500/(1.732x400) = 16.6 Amps per phase 16.6 x 3 = 49.8 Amps so i need a 50 Amp breaker.

EDM - Electrical Discharge Machining is a way of cutting metal using electricity Similar to a plasma cutter except under water. The process is very common in manufacturing of injection molds. The process can be as simple as using a small diameter metal tube to cut a precise hole in a metal block to using a carved graphite block to machine a toy shape in a metal block for injection molding.

The US benchmark for water use within pulp and paper mills is approximately 17000 gallons/ton of paper with one of the most efficient kraft pulp and paper mills only using 4500 gallons/ton. With an effective safe-all system that incorporates restrictive water circuits a mill can minimize both the need for incoming make-up freshwater and the release of effluent.
