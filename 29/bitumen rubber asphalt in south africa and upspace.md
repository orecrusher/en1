## [PDF] Investigating the in situ Properties of Crumb Rubber 
The heterogeneous nature of crumb rubber modified (CRM) bitumen makes it impossible to extract from asphalt as a single component. It is recovered as two separate entities namely the rubber crumbs and the solvent soluble fraction containing the base binder. Additionally the solvent recovery process destroys the chemical equilibrium of the CRM bitumen blend; this makes it impossible to re
