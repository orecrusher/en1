## Gold Refining 
 · The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold. The Miller process is rapid and simple but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity. The Wohlwill process increases purity to about 99.99 percent by electrolysis

The BFD of the overall process is shown in Figure 1. The PFD for Unit 100 shown in Figure 2 is designed to reduce 41.5 tons/hr of gold ore from a feed range of 2-5" to 160 microns. The mined ore is fed using a Grizzly Feeder F-101 into a Jaw Crusher J-101 where 80% of the ore is crushed to 1.75" or smaller. The remaining 20% are

## 9.10.2.2 Peanut Processing 
A typical shelled peanut processing flow diagram is shown in Figure 9.10.2.2-2. Shelling begins with separating the foreign material with a series of screens blowers and magnets. The cleaned peanuts are then sized with screens (size graders). Sizing is required so that peanut pods can be crushed without also crushing the peanut kernels.

viable to process mineral resources very much depends on the type of ore which is mined as well as of the physical conditions linked to the loion of the mine site. Heap leaching is a tried and tested mining technique enabling the processing of different kinds of ores which could not otherwise be exploited under viable economic conditions.

## Gold 
Processing. The processing of gold ore involves crushing treatment with chemicals melting (smelting) and further purifiion. It is then poured into moulds where it cools and hardens as gold bars called 'bullion' which make the gold easy to stack and transport. The first stage of processing gold ore is crushing.

 · 1. Crushing the rock. I wish this process could be as easy as it sounds. However if you crush the rock the wrong way then you will end up losing some of the valuable gold. Use a bash plate and a very strong container when crushing the stone to get the gold so that you do not lose any piece of gold.
