## What is the purpose of limestone in a blast furnace
limestone is used to remove impurities in the furnace and the main impurity of the blast furnace is silica (sand and rock) which is silicon dioxide. silicon dioxide is a solid at furnace temperatures so it reacts with calcium oxide from the decomposition of limestone (CaCO3). this result into the formation of calcium silie (CaSiO3) or slag which is a liquid. slag flows to the the bottom of the furnace where it floats
