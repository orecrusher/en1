The approximate Steel consumption per sq.ft built up area (BUA) is 4 kg per sqft (for low rise construction i.e. less than 4 floors of construction). Steel contributes the most among all individual materials about 25% of total material cost. So a price rise of Rs.5 per kg can make big difference in the total cost of construction.
