## Slope Stability 
If a weak rock or soil occurs between stronger rocks or soils the weak layer will be the most likely place for failure to occur especially if the layer dips in a down-slope direction as in the illustration above. Similarly loose unconsolidated sand has no cohesive strength. A layer of such sand then becomes a weak layer in the slope.

## All About Arena Sand 
Natural sand has eroded from mountain rock and is mined from where it was deposited. The host rock determines the exact mineral composition but most sand is composed of silica from broken down quartz crystals. This type of sand is extremely resistant to weathering and breakdown due to its chemical hardness and will last longer as arena footing.
