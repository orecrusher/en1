and Distributed What is Wind Energy? Wind energy is a form of solar energy. Earth's atmosphere is unevenly heated by solar radiation and the air is in constant motion to find equilibrium. Air is easily affected by pressure and temperature so methods of heat transfer such as convection conduction radiation and advection relieve the temperature

Zinc ores are widely distributed throughout the world although more than 40 percent of the world's output originates in North America and Australia. The common zinc-containing minerals are the zinc sulfide known as zinc blende or sphalerite (ZnS) a ferrous form of zinc blende known as marmatite [(ZnFe)S] and a zinc carbonate known as calamine or smithsonite (ZnCO 3).

## How Ore Deposits Are Formed? 
Finding new ore deposits in the Earth's crust depends on our understanding how nature forms such gigantic metal accumulations that can be exploited at reasonable economic and environmental expense. Until now geologists have primarily studied these deposits using field observations and geochemical analyses but were unable to fully understand the physical processes of ore formation.
