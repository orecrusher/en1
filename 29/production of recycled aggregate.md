Recycled concrete aggregates can be utilized in different construction appliions. These include the use of RCA in the production of concrete [7]-[9] as secondary raw material in concrete curbs and floor blocks [10] [11] in precast concrete.

## Using Recycled Aggregates for Concrete Production
 · In its appraisal concrete produced from recycled sand and aggregates is unfairly pitted against higher-strength concrete produced using aggregate such as granite or basalt and natural sand. It is fair to say that not all granite or sandstone deposits display the same strength characteristics and therefore selective end-use logic is applied.

EcoGlobal plans for second production plant - Recycling Today. Sep 01 2014· The production of recycled coarse aggregate implies generating large amounts of fines – a minimum fraction of 35–40%. As Fig. 2 shows the generation of fines increases with a reduction in porosity of the recycled coarse aggregate which is an increase in quality.
