The calculation now reads 311 – 550 ÷ 25 + 10; Next division and multipliion. There is no multipliion but the division is 550 ÷ 25 = 22. Now the calculation reads 311 – 22 + 10. Although you still have two operations left addition and subtraction rank equally so you just go from left to right. 311 – 22 = 289 and 289 + 10 = 299.

 · Today primary crushing is viewed as more important within the balance of production and proper sizing needs. The size and type of the primary crusher should be coordinated with the type of stone drilling and blasting patterns and the size of the loading machine. Most operations will use a gyratory jaw or impact crusher for primary crushing.
