## A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel 
Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized – a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.

## The Iron Pelletizing Process: Part One :: Total Materia 
The iron pelletizing process is often associated with low grade iron ore following a range of liberation techniques to prepare and make suitable for the blast furnace. In summary pelletizing is achieved by combining the iron ore with water and a specific binder which is then rolled up in drum to produce relatively uniform pellets which can then be easily handled in downstream processes.
