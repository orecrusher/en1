## Dense Medium Cyclone Handbook 
Dense medium cyclones were introduced into Australian washeries in the 1950s. Modern circuits continue to be based on the strong foundations provided by the Dutch State Mines and Stamicarbon BV but over the ensuing decades many innovations have been trialed. Many have been rejected and others have proven useful and have been widely adopted:

## Dense Medium Separation 
Dense medium separation (DMS) is a robust process that can be conducted at particle sizes as coarse as 300 mm and as fine as 500 µm with high separation efficiency depending on liberation characteristics of the value minerals. The DMS process involves three steps: feed preparation dense medium separation and ferrous-based media recovery.
