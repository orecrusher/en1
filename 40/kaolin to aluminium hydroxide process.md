## Aluminium 
The aluminium hydroxide powder is separated from the silies. Then it is heated and fused to form alumina. The above process is used when the bauxite is free from major impurities. If the impurities like ferric oxide and silie are present as contact minerals then only aluminium hydroxide can be separated from there.

## Aluminium hydroxide 
Aluminium hydroxide Al(OH) 3 is found in nature as the mineral gibbsite (also known as hydrargillite) and its three much rarer polymorphs: bayerite doyleite and nordstrandite.Aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric i.e. it has both basic and acidic properties. Closely related are aluminium oxide hydroxide AlO(OH) and aluminium oxide or alumina (Al 2 O 3) the latter of which is also amphoteric.
