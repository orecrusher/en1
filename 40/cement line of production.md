## How is fiber cement board manufacture
Fiber cement board are composed of cement silica sand and wood pulp. Reinforced fiber cement products such as fiber cement board are manufactured using the 'Hatscheck Process'. The Hatsheck process was initially developed for the production of asbestos composites but it is now used for the manufacture of non-asbestos cellulose fiber reinforced cement composites.
