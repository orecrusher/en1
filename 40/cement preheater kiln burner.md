## Preheat Towers 
Kiln preheater towers provide heat transfer from hot gases to kiln feed material. The counterflow of gases and material takes place in cyclones referred to as stages in the preheat tower. As material flows from the top to bottom of the tower it is exposed to increasingly higher temperatures as it is prepared to enter the kiln.
