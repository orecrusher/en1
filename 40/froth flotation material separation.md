## Froth Flotation Process 
Flotation is the process of separation of beneficial minerals from a mixture by creating froth on which minerals separate out. This method of froth floatation is a method of mineral processing in which different minerals are separated selectively. Such ores containing multiple metals such as lead copper and zinc can be selectively extracted by

## Froth flotation 
Froth flotation is a selective process for separating minerals from gangue by using surfactants and wetting agents. The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is mixed) ores economically feasible. The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of sulfides carbonates and oxides prior to further refinement.

Froth flotation is a process using air bubbles to separate materials based on their relative affinity to water. Bubbles carry reagent and hydrophobic materials to the top of a tank where they can be removed. Froth flotation has been used for more than a century in mining operations to separate valuable materials from excavated ores.

## Froth_flotation 
Froth flotation is a selective process for separating minerals from gangue by using surfactants and wetting agents. The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is mixed) ores economically feasible. The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of sulfides carbonates and oxides prior to further refinement.
