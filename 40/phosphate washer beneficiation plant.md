Jan 20 2019 · Many other developing countries have discoveries and are considering their new deposits often with difficult beneficiation problems as potential sources of phosphate. Florida Phosphates. Florida phosphate occurs in a sand-clay matrix overlaid by unconsolidated overburden of sand and sandy clays ranging from 10 feet to 45 feet in depth.

acid plants include venturi wet cyclonic and semi-cross-flow scrubbers. The leachate portion of the fluorine may be deposited in settling ponds. If the pond water becomes saturated with fluorides fluorine gas may be emitted to the atmosphere. The reactor in which phosphate rock is reacted with sulfuric acid is the main source of emissions.
