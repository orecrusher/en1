Mineral Processing. If the mineralogy of the ore shows that you can separate discrete particles of the mineral you want from the gangue components of the ore then it is possible to physically concentrate the valuable mineral and reject the rest. The easiest method for achieving this is by gravity separation.

Many of the particles encountered in mining are characterized by sieves (classifiers). Recent advances in computers cameras and software make image analysis practical for samples with sizes larger than several microns in diameter. As particle size decreases sieving and/or dynamic image analysis becomes more arduous or impossible and laser diffraction becomes the technique of choice.
