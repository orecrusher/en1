## Rotating unbalance 
Rotating unbalance is the uneven distribution of mass around an axis of rotation. A rotating mass or rotor is said to be out of balance when its center of mass (inertia axis) is out of alignment with the center of rotation (geometric axis). Unbalance causes a moment which gives the rotor a wobbling movement characteristic of vibration of rotating structures.

## Eccentric Shaft 
Eccentric Shaft: Empower Mfg. produces eccentric shaft/shafts that give most other manufacturers a headache due to the imbalances that occur when turning centers. We've specialized in eccentric shafts for decades and have developed the processes to efficiently make shafts with offset features on each end—eccentric lobes/weights added for a specific function.

Eccentric PressThe eccentric press uses a motor to drive an eccentric shaft rotating in a connecting rod. The connecting rod moves a ram in a slider joint one dimensionally. The eccentric shaft itself is round therefore it may completely rotate within the connecting rod. The center of the drive is not the center of the overall shaft.

 · The ends of the shaft are required to be eccentric within 002mm (I dont know if this is the right way to explain it but I hope you understand.) Because of the length and the difficult tolerance of the diameter the shaft has to be machined in two operations and this makes the eccentricity hard to achieve but I believe that I have found a way to machine the part within all given tolerances.
