## What is Phosphate Fertilizer? (with pictures)
Phosphate fertilizer is a fertilizer that is high in phosphorous. Most phosphate fertilizer comes from phosphate rock a mineral mined in massive quantities of millions of tons from loions around the world. This mineral provides one of the three main nutrients needed by all plants for vigorous growth; the other two are nitrogen and potassium.
