## Hypothetical Iron Ore Conveyor Design 
Aug 14 2007 · I need to design a conveyor for a class I am studying. Its rather simple. Needs to transport Iron Ore 500m from a crusher to a stockpile 5.2m/s and 3000tph. The problem being there is a lake of 400m diameter between the two. Any tips or suggestions would be apprieciated. I have the option of going around the lake but this would require three conveyors and hence additional chutes.
