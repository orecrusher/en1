Abstract. Global production of cement has grown very rapidly in recent years and after fossil fuels and land-use change it is the third-largest source of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. The availability of the required data for estimating emissions from global cement production is poor and it has been recognised that some global estimates are significantly inflated.
