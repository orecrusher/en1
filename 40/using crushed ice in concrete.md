Crushed concrete waste is a by-product from building demolition and constitutes a principal component of municipal solid waste consisting of concrete sand brick rock metals and timber. Over 50% of this waste is commonly sent to land-filled sites resulting in the impact on the limited capacity of land-filled sites. Nowadays the sources of natural aggregates aredepleted by increases

Before the concrete is scooped into the moulds the moulds must be lightly coated in a mould release agent. This ensures that the concrete does not stick to the mould and makes it easier to remove the cube. When using a 150mm mould the concrete sample is scooped into the mould in 3 equal layers (50mm) and compacted between each layer.

## Why How to Use Recycled Crushed Concrete 
 · Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) — also called "crushed concrete" — is made up of asphalt debris from other construction projects that can be reused to create driveways pathways garden beds and more. When any concrete structure road sidewalk or parking lot is destroyed that concrete is often deposited in a landfill.

 · For most concrete the maximum temperature reduction is approximately 20°F. For correct proportioning the ice must be weighed. Ice has a two-way cooling effect. First it draws heat from the concrete for melting of ice then the resulting water at 32°F provides continuing cooling capacity.
