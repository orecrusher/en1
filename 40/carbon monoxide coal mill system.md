## Carbon monoxide 
Carbon monoxide has a computed fractional bond order of 2.6 indiing that the "third" bond is important but constitutes somewhat less than a full bond. Thus in valence bond terms – C≡O + is the most important structure while :C=O is non-octet but has a neutral formal charge on each atom and represents the second most important resonance contributor.

Measuring carbon monoxide (CO) can help to determine the excess oxygen setpoint. CO is the most sensitive indior of incomplete combustion. As the amount of excess O 2 is reduced the emergence of CO will occur before other combustibles appear (unburnt fuel). When the concentration of CO reaches the desired setpoint (typically around 400 ppm
