## When a Building Comes Down Where Do Its Materials Go?
Jan 30 2019 · Concrete. Concrete is critical in laying foundations delineating floors and walls and reinforcing building elements but its compositional ingredients of cement and aggregate are not renewable. (Sand for example concrete's most common aggregate is being harvested to near exhaustion.) There are at least two major barriers to recycling

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction 
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete for each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS 2013b). Thus the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

The concrete itself becomes aggregate and any embedded metals can be removed and recycled as well. As space for landfills becomes premium this not only helps reduce the need for landfills but also reduces the economic impact of the project. Moreover using recycled concrete aggregates reduces the need for aggregates.
