Apr 01 2019 · Limestone is the raw material for producing the largest amount of cement. After mining the particle size is larger and the hardness is higher. Therefore the crushing of limestone plays an important role in the material crushing of cement plants. The material crushing process is more economical and convenient than the grinding process.

## From raw materials Extracting raw materials Raw material 
The most important raw materials for making cement are limestone clay and marl. These are extracted from quarries by blasting or by ripping using heavy machinery. Wheel loaders and dumper trucks transport the raw materials to the crushing installations. There the rock is broken down to roughly the size used in road metalling.

## Hammer Crusher for Cement Raw Material
Hammer crusher mainly relies on the impact energy to complete the crushing material operation. When hammer crusher is working the motor drives the rotor to rotate at high speed and raw material enters the crusher cavity evenly. High-speed rotary hammer impacts and shears the tearing material causing raw material to be broken.

## Limestone quarry quarrying cement raw materials
Since a form of calcium carbonate usually limestone is the predominant raw material most plants are situated near a limestone quarry or receive this material from a source via inexpensive transportation. Cement manufacturing begins with quarrying operations in which limestone in mines is quarried and brought to crusher for crushing.

## Raw Material Substitution 
The main raw material used in cement production has traditionally been limestone. Limestone is abundantly available but over 60% of the industry's CO 2 emissions are caused by transformation of limestone into lime called "decarbonation". Accordingly part of the route towards a low carbon concrete-built environment can involve limestone substitution.

## Crushing 
Crushing is the phase of size reduction of the raw material which is carried out before the grinding and cooking processes and must meet the following parameters. Produce raw material whose fineness (particle size) is adequate to produce clinker in the required quality; Obtain the proper raw mix by supplying components in the correct ratio.
