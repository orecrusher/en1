 · In crushers like C105 and C3055 the jaw die design on the ends is different. The lock-ing wedges on these crushers are loed behind the jaw dies rather than at the top of the jaw die. Jaw dies can be allowed to wear until the thickness is 60 to 65 mm thick or the teeth are worn flat. On other crushers the ends of the jaw dies are much thinner.
