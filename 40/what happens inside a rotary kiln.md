## Simulation of Combustion and Thermal
 · A computational model is established to simulate the combustion and thermal-flow behavior inside a petcoke rotary calcining kiln. The results show that peak temperature is loed at the tertiary air zone and a cold region that exists between the natural gas combustion zone and the tertiary air zone causes the coke bed to lose heat to the gas stream.

Calcining is an energy intensive industry and a significant amount of heat is wasted in the calcining process. Efficiently managing this energy resource is tied to the profit margin and survivability of a calcining plant. 3-D computational models are developed using FLUENT to simulate the calcining process inside the long slender kiln.

The combined radiation and convection heat transfer is the total heat input into the bed of a rotary kiln. Perhaps the most important concern is what happens to the energy after it is directed to the bed. A truly complete thermal evaluation of the kiln must therefore include the subsequent distribution of energy within the bed as intended for materials processing. In this chapter we evaluate the heat transfer
