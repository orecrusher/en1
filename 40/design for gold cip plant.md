## design for gold cip plant 
design for gold cip plant. Carbon-in-pulp(CIP) is the sequential leach then absorption ofgoldfrom ore. During theCIP stage pulp flows through several agitated tanks where sodium cyanide and oxygen have been added to dissolvegoldinto solution. In the absorption stage this solution flows through several agitated tanks containing activated carbon.

Highlights Worldwide gold recovery on activated carbon grew from zero to almost 70% in twenty years from 1980. The stellar attributes of carbon gold plants led to complacency in the industry in designing and operating these plants. Most CIP and CIL plants are overdesigned and operated sub-optimally. Optimum design criteria and operating conditions are easily determined with simple test work

Elemental gold has a specific gravity of 19.3 and typical ore has a specific gravity of about 2.6. All gravity concentration devices create movement between the gold and host rock particles in a manner to separate the heavy pieces from the lighter pieces of material. The prospector's gold pan is the most familiar gravity concentration device.
