## Sulfide Ores 
If sulfide ores containing iron and copper are to be smelted an understanding of both the iron and the copper systems is needed. Again as in Figure 2.1.3 for the Cu–S–O system the calculations are limited to oxidation by industrial oxygen so that the pressure of SO 2 will be about 1 atm. except where oxygen pressure is appreciable near the top of the diagram [ 3 ].
