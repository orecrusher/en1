The grinding action is by attrition and abrasion in which very fine particles are chipped from the surfaces of larger particles rather than impact breakage.

## Stirred Milling Technology – A New Concept in Fine Grinding
Unlike tumbling mills where comminution occurs from both impact and attrition grinding in stirred media mills the particles suffer almost entirely attrition breakage between the beads. (Napier-Munn et al. 2005). In stirred mills there are no free-falling possibilities for grinding media meaning that impact action does not occur.

2. History of development and different mill designs Originally tumbling ball mills were often used for wet fine and ultrafine grinding. But since the power consumption of tumbling ball mills is limited by the number of revolutions at which the grinding media are centrifugated at the chamber wall the power density is relatively small.

 · In this mill the mill shell is rotated and motion is imparted to the charge via the mill shell. The grinding medium may be steel rods balls or rock itself. Tumbling mills are typically employed in the mineral industry for coarse-grinding processes in which particles between 5 and 250 mm are reduced in size to between 40 and 300 microns.

## Stirred Mill 
A typical stirred mill with a vertical rotating shaft and horizontal arms is shown in Fig. 2.20. This stirring action causes a differential movement between balls and the material being milled thus a substantially higher degree of surface contact than is achieved in tumbling or vibratory mills is ensured.
