## Iron ore concentrates 
Iron ore concentrates are non-toxic non-flammable and non-explosive. 4. Low level of impurities. Their low content of impurities makes iron ore concentrates highly efficient as a ferrous-metallurgy input. 5. Drying during winter periodDried concentrate is efficient for transportation when the air temperature is below freezing.
