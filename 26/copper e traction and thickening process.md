## copper extraction and purifiion 
Extracting copper from other ores. Copper can be extracted from non-sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulphate solution.

## Hydrometallurgy 
Extraction is orders of magnitude faster than either in-place or heap/percolation leaching methods. The supernatant liquor containing the dissolved metal values is collected as the overflow from a thickener. Once the copper and any other metals of interest have been obtained in solution the copper may be recovered by a variety of methods.
