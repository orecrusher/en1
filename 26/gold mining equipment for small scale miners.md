For example one miner improved his recovery from 40% to 70% simply by screening his feed from 8mm to 2mm. No gold was lost because his largest gold was around .5mm. The iCON method will improve your process by screening your feed to the proper size. This will reduce the volume of feed and increase the percentage of gold that you recover.

## » The Basics of Successful Gold Mining
However gold that is large enough for us to recover with our small-scale mining equipment generally does not move in a riverbed to a large extent except during major flood storms. Storms of this magnitude are able to generate enough water force and turbulence to get all or most of the streambed material flowing down the riverbed along with the water.

Small scale mining. There are major challenges ahead for small-scale mining in South Africa. With the advent of the new Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act in 2002 many previously disadvantaged South Africans have begun to see small-scale mining as a way to a new life.

 · In non-Fairtrade small-scale gold mines miners can work in dangerous conditions with little or no health and safety equipment. Accident rates are six or seven times higher than in large-scale mining. Miners extract gold using toxic chemicals such as mercury and cyanide.

## Access to Finance 
The amount of money invested in each unit of gold produced by artisanal and small-scale miners is vastly lower than that available for the industrial formal gold mining sector. While ASGM exploration and production have typically been seen as risky investments the investment landscape is changing due in part to increasing consumer and corporate demand for responsibly mined artisanal gold.

## The Borax Method of Gold Extraction for Small
 · The method is easy to learn and does not require expensive equipment. Today more than ten million artisanal and small-scale gold miners (ASGM) worldwide extract gold using mercury. About 1400 tonnes/year of mercury is used by the ASGM sector making this the largest source of the global mercury demand.
