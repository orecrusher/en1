However talc has vast appliions in the cosmetics paper and paint industries due to its high chemical stability and its demand continues to grow. Since flotation is the most effective beneficiation technique for upgrading sulfides the high hydrophobicity of talc has made its selective separation challenging.

## Froth flotation 
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
