## Sand 
 · Sand Composition and ShapeMost sand is made of quartz or its microcrystalline cousin chalcedony because that common mineral is resistant to weathering. The farther from its source rock a sand is the closer it is to pure quartz. But many "dirty" sands contain feldspar grains tiny bits of rock (lithics) or dark minerals like ilmenite and

 · Chromite Sand is special sand for foundry. It is a natural spinel dominated by chromite. After crushing grinding and sieving it is divided into prescribed grain size and is suitable for sand for molding (core-making). Chromium ore sand can be divided into two grades according to chemical composition first grade Cr2O3 (> 45%) and second grade Cr2O3 (> 35%).
