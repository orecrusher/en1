## 5
The term "5-axis" refers to the number of directions in which the cutting tool can move. On a 5-axis machining center the cutting tool moves across the X Y and Z linear axes as well as rotates on the A and B axes to approach the workpiece from any direction. In other words you can process five sides of a part in a single setup.

Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
