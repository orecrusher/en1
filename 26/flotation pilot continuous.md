## Inclusion removal by bubble flotation in a continuous 
Fundamentally based computational models are developed and applied to quantify the removal of inclusions by bubbles during the continuous casting of steel. First the attachment probability of inclusions on a bubble surface is investigated based on fundamental fluid flow simulations incorporating the turbulent inclusion trajectory and sliding time of each individual inclusion along the bubble

Float voltage is the voltage at which a battery is maintained after being fully charged to maintain that capacity by compensating for self-discharge of the battery. The voltage could be held constant for the entire duration of the cell's operation (such as in an automotive battery) or could be held for a particular phase of charging by the charger.

A constant level of de-aerated liquid eliminates the risk of malfunctions by the level transmitter. Precise control of the feed flows to the flotation cells and the accept flow from the secondary stage allows stable operation without any undesirable variations in performance.

Create a sphere and add an attribute to it (the shape node not the transform node). Use the naming convention 'mtoa_constant_' followed by the same name we gave for our Ai User Data Float node - 'Float'. So it would be named ' mtoa_constant_Float'.; In the extra attributes for the sphere you should see the new attribute 'mtoa_constant_Float' with a value of 1.

## The effect of particle size on coal flotation kinetics: A 
The flotation kinetic model is the most commonly used flotation model that relates different process parameters which are related to particle slurry and hydrodynamic properties to flotation rate constant. Particle size is known to be one of the most important parameters in coal flotation due to its significant effect on flotation rate.
