conveyor design. Upgrading conveyors will actually reduce the cost of ownership as well as provide a safer processing environment. | Easy to sanitize: Homogeneous belts offer the fastest wash down regimes with no removal of belts from conveyors. Water consumption and labor is saved; the environmental cost is low and production time is freed up.

The belt widths are as follows: 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 72 84 and 96 inches. The width of the narrower belts may be governed by the size of lumps to be handled. Belts must be wide enough so that any combination of prevailing lumps and finer material does not load the lumps too close to the edge of the conveyor belt.
