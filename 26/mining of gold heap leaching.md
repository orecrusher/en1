Heap leaching: In the open cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads. The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap. The pad collects the now metal-impregnated solution which is stripped of gold and resprayed on the heap until the ore is depleted.

## Rio2 selects ROM heap leaching at Fenix 
 · Canadian miner Rio2 plan to use Run-of-Mine (ROM) heap leaching instead of a gyratory crusher at its Fenix Gold Project in Chile following positive trial results. A recovery of approximately 60% for gold was achieved in the trial ROM heap within 30 days of leaching commencing. Processing > Chemicals-reagents. 22 June 2021.

## The use of geometallurgy in the processing of a complex 
As mining progressed the ore became less oxidised and harder in texture with the result that gold recoveries in the heaps started to decrease. In 2012 it was decided that agitation leaching should be introduced to operate in parallel with heap leaching with high grade ore (>1.5 g/t Au) going to agitation leaching and low

## Cyanide Leach Packet 
There are 2 types of cyanide leach mining: vat and heap-leaching. In 1998 approximately 70% of gold recovered from cyanide use was from vat-leaching operations about 30% from heap-leaching operations.3 All in all cyanide leaching is now used to process over 90% of gold ores (by weight) mined in the United States.4

heap-leach technology has developed significantly over the past 15 years. Use of cyanide heap leaching has steadily increased due to its low cost for recovering gold and silver. Northern Nevada was the site of the first small-scale commercial cyanide heap-leach operation by the Carlin Gold Mining Company in the late 1960s (Hiskey 1985).

Since the middle of the 16th century heap leaching was practiced in Hungary for copper extraction. In 1969 gold heap leaching began in Nevada (birth place of modern heap leaching) and in the middle of the 20th century the United States Bureau of Mines began applying this technology. Gold and silver heap leaching ﬁrst began at Cortez in 1969.
