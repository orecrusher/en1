## Wohlwill process 
For industrial gold production the Wohlwill process is necessary for highest purity gold appliions. When lower purity gold is required refiners often utilize the Miller process due to its relative ease quicker turnaround times and because it does not require a large inventory of gold in the form of chloroauric acid on site at all times.
