## Heap Leaching 
 · Heap leaching of gold and silver ores is conducted at approximately 120 mines worldwide. Heap leaching is one of several alternative process methods for treating precious metal ores and is selected primarily to take advantage of its low capital cost relative to other methods. Thirty-seven different heap leach operations with a total production of 198 tonnes of gold per year ( ounces

 · This process called the "leach cycle" generally takes from one or two months for simple oxide ores (e.g. most gold ores) to two years for nickel laterite ores. The leach solution containing the dissolved minerals is then collected treated in a process plant to recover the target mineral and in some cases precipitate other minerals and recycled to the heap after reagent levels are adjusted.

Focussing on the gold industry Gekko replace high-energy whole ore treatment of gold by carbon-in-leach (CIL) methodologies with beneficial low-energy process solutions. Harnessing both gravity separation and floatation as well as dramatically reducing the initial mass to be processed by pre-concentration Gekko flowsheets increase the grade for downstream intensive processing.
