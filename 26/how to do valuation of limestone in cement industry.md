## Benefits of cement
Lime has been an important component of mortars for over 2000 years. The characteristics of hydrated lime provide unique benefits in masonry appliions that distinguish cement-lime mortars from other masonry mortar materials. Major benefits include: Flexural bond strength Cement and Type S Hydrated Lime mortars have been shown to have high levels of flexural bond strength.
