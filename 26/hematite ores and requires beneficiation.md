## Hematite and Itabirite 
Hematite is often cheaper to process than other forms of iron ore as it generally does not require beneficiation due to its higher iron content. However hematite ores may contain higher concentrations of contaminant elements (such as phosphorus alumina and silica) and may therefore need to be blended prior to smelting.

## Hematite 
Low-grade hematite ores need to be upgraded to achieve the required iron content which involves more complied ore beneficiation processes. The level of comminution required for the low-grade hematite ore is similar to high-grade ores to deliver the same products lumps and fines.

## Iron ore and its beneficiation: 
 · Iron ore and its beneficiation: Most useful metal in the world Iron is extracted from iron ore. It is the rock from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. Iron ore is a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). The iron ore usually very rich in iron oxides (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3).
