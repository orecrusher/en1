Aggregates Aggregates generally occupy 65- 80% of a concrete's volume. Aggregates are inert fillers floating in the cement paste matrix for concretes of low strength.

## Effect of Aggregates on the Properties of Concrete 
The crushing strength test discussed above has been found insensitive to the variation in strength of weaker aggregates. Therefore when such aggregates are tested by this method they do not give true picture because they get crushed before the full load of 40 tonne has been applied and get compacted causing the plunger to jam.

Aggregates may be broadly classi fied as natural or artificial both with respect to source and to method of preparation. Natural sands and gravels are the product of weathering and the action of wind or water while manufactured crushed fine aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone.
