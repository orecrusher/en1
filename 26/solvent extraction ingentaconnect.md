 · Solvent Extraction: Solvent Extraction is a separation method in which a solution (usually aqueous) comes into contact with a second solvent (usually organic) that is immiscible with the first to pass the solvent into the second solvent.. This occurs through the partitioning process which involves the distribution of a solute between two immiscible liquid phases.
