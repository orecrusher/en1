Ore mineralogy affects the shape and size distribution of iron ore particles. In the same crushing circuit friable ore textures tend to generate more fine materials.Ore particles of different mineralogical characteristics also tend to have different physical characteristics and are subject to different breakage mechanisms when crushed.

## Beneficiation 
Beneficiation can begin within the mine itself. Most mines will have a crusher within the mine itself where separation of ore and gangue minerals occurs and as a side effect becomes easier to transport. After the crusher the ore will go through a grinder or a mill to get the ore into fine particles.
