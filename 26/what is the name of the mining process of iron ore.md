## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron 
 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.

Once a suitably sized deposit of a mineral has been found mining can begin. In ancient times mining and mineral processing were very primitive and the main method used to extract ores was digging by hand. Mining is largely divided into surface and underground mining. Minerals are often found in river beds beach sands and other sandy areas.

It is non-magnetic and has colour variations ranging from steel silver to reddish brown. Pure hematite contains 69.9% Fe by molecular weight. It has been the dominant iron ore mined in Australia since the early 1960s.

There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.

Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings for inclusion in a seedbank which will form the basis of post-mining revegetation of the site. Next the top soil is removed and is usually also stored for replacement during rehabilitation.

## Iron Ore Smelting Process 
 · Iron ore is obtained in the conventional method of open cast or underground mining and conveying the ore to the surface preparation are where it is crushed washed and transported to the smelter. Here the ore is put into a blast furnace along with limestone and coke and subjected to hot air blasting and heat which converts the ore to molten iron.

## How Is Cast Iron Made? 
 · The making of cast iron begins with a combination of raw materials. Iron is rarely found in its pure form. Only meteorites contain pure iron. The iron in use for centuries is found in the combination of iron and other elements. These combinations are known as iron oxides. Mining pulls most of the iron from iron ores

 · There are two distinct egories of iron ore mining surface mining such as open cast or strip mining and underground mining. At the surface iron ore processing plants the iron ore is put through crushers and ball mills to break it into a uniform and more workable size and then washed with the residue going to tailings.
