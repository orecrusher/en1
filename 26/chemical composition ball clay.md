3. Clay Clay particles are the finest of all the soil particles measuring fewer than 0.002 mm in size. It consists of microscopic and sub-microscopic particles derived from the chemical decomposition of rocks. Clay is a fine grained cohesive soil. They stick together readily and form a sticky or gluey texture when they are wet or dry.

Clay minerals are produced mainly from the chemical weathering and decomposition of feldspars such as orthoclase and plagioclase and some micas. They are small in size and very flaky in shape. The key to some of the properties of clay soils e.g. plasticity compressibility swelling/shrinkage potential lies in the structure of clay minerals.

## What is Ball Clay? 
Ball clays are sedimentary in origin. Ancient rivers and streams washed kaolinite (formed from decomposed granite) from its parent rock. As the streams flowed from upland area they mixed with other clay minerals sands gravels and vegetation before settling in low-lying basins to form overlaying seams of ball clay.

## Kaolinite: The clay mineral kaolinite information and pictures
Kaolinite is a clay mineral with a soft consistency and earthy texture. It is easily broken and can be molded or shaped especially when wet. Kaolinite is a lackluster and uninteresting mineral on its own but it occasionally forms interesting pseudomorphs especially after feldspars. It is also a common accessory to other minerals including gem crystals in decomposing feldspar pegmatites.
