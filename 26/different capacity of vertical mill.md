## How to Calculate Production Capacity of a Factory?
 · Answer: Good question. In the production capacity calculation formula we are using product SAM to calculate the daily production capacity. Therefore if you are adding finishing operation SAM manual work (like marking ironing) SAM into the total garment SAM those workstations will be part of the calculating factory capacity working hours.

## Vertical Axis Wind Turbines Advantages Disadvantages
 · The vertical design allows engineers to place the turbines closer together. Groups of them don't have to be spaced far apart so a wind farm does not have to take up as much ground area. The proximity of horizontal wind turbines to one another can create turbulence and reductions in wind speed that affects the output of neighboring units.
