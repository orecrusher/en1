 · Underground mining is when tunnels are dug under the ground and the ore is mined from the tunnel walls. This is sometimes done with special tools but more commonly with explosives. As nickel is commonly found with other metals especially iron it is mined as an ore that needs to be separated and refined to produce nickel.

## The Actual Difference Between Surface and Underground Mining
Surface mining is suitable for large low-grade ore deposits which occur below a thin layer of rock or alluvial deposits found in sand and riverbeds. Underground mining is used for small high-grade deposits covered with a thick overburden (soil and rock above the ore) or for deep and sloping deposits.

## Mining 
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth usually from an ore body lode vein seam reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized commodity that is of economic interest to the miner. Ores recovered by mining include metals coal oil shale gemstones limestone chalk dimension stone rock salt potash gravel and clay.

## What is Underground Mining? (with pictures)
Underground mining is a technique used to access ores and valuable minerals in the ground by digging into the ground to extract them. This is in contrast with techniques like open pit mining in which the surface layers of ground are scooped away to access deposits or mountaintop removal in which the top of a mountain is simply shaved off to access the ore inside.

## Open Cut and Underground Mining 
Underground Mining is generally used for areas where the mineral seam is too far underground for open cut mining to be of use. A tunnel called a decline is created to allow workers and machinery to reach the loion of the minerals. Stope mining is used for most hard rock mining of minerals such as copper silver lead and zinc.

These deposits usually occur beneath barriers like a rock layer forests or oceans which makes accessing them difficult. Depending on how these ores are extracted mining methods can be egorized as 'surface' or 'underground' types. In surface mining the rock barrier on top of the deposit is removed to access the ore.
