Strip mining became the preferred method in southeastern Kansas in the 1930s although underground mining continued there until 1960 and in Osage County until 1964. During strip mining operations overlying soil and rock called overburden is stripped away using power shovels to expose coal beds too thin to be mined underground.

Ore mining modules (mining lasers and strip miners) mine between 40 and 180 m 3 of ore per minute by default; improving ore mining efficiency therefore involves increasing this mining rate. For example: a beginning miner fits her Venture with two Miner I modules giving her a total yield of (say) 200 m 3 /min with a cycle time of 60 seconds.
