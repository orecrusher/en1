Underground Coal Gasifiion (UCG) takes advantage of the same chemical reactions of coal to produce product gases as those occurring in conventional gasifier reactors. The main difference is that in UCG the underground coal seam itself becomes the reactor so that the gasifiion of the coal takes place underground instead of in a manufactured gasifiion vessel at the surface.1 Obviously

## Determining the size and life of underground coal mines
The determination of mine design variables such as mine shaft loions mine field dimensions mine design capacity and mine service life under various mining conditions is of primary importance to the economics of developing and subsequently operating an underground coal mine.

When the 1969 Coal Mine Health and Safety Act was enacted U.S. coal production was about 600 million tons with about 60 percent underground mining and 40 percent surface mining. Longwall mining accounted for less than 1 percent of the underground production; room-and-pillar continuous mining accounted for about 50 percent of the underground production.

## Coal 
Underground mining sometimes called deep mining is a process that retrieves coal from deep below the Earth's surface—sometimes as far as 300 meters (1000 feet). Miners travel by elevator down a mine shaft to reach the depths of the mine and operate heavy machinery that extracts the coal and moves it

Underground Mining. Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.In deep mining the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof.
