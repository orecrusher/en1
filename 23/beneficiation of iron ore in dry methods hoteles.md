Most of the Iron ore washing plants set up in India in the earlier days consist of sizing of the ore by dry / wet screening washing and classifiion by screw classifiers. In this classical approach iron values were lost in the form of fines and utrafines into the tailing ponds as they had little commercial value in those days and accumulated in huge quantities over the years.
