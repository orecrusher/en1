## Vibration : Measure Acceleration Velocity or Displacement 
 · When using vibration data especially in conjunction with modelling systems the measured data is often needed as an acceleration as a velocity and as a displacement. Sometimes different analysis groups require the measured signals in a different form. Clearly it is impractical to measure all three at once even if we could.
