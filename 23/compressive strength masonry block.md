## Block Strength Map – Structural Masonry Coalition
For the design of masonry structural elements there are two methods to verify masonry compressive strength: 1) unit strength method or 2) prism test method. In a prism test an assembly of materials (masonry block mortar and grout) representative of the actual materials used on the project are tested for its compressive strength at 28 days or any designated test age.

The compressive strength of a unit is based on its gross or overall area. The class of masonry unit required is described by reference to its nominal compressive strength in MPa. The minimum strength of blocks is 35 MPa and of bricks 7 MPa. Normally all units with a compressive strength exceeding 105 MPa are solid i.e. not hollow.

## Flexural Tensile Strength of Concrete Block Masonry 
This paper reports the results of 172 flexural tests of 790 mm by 1590 mm (31 in. × 62 in.) concrete block masonry walls. In addition to evaluating tensile strength both normal and parallel to the bed joint the parameters included in the study are three sizes of block; three percentages of solid; four block strengths; two types of mortar; hollow blocks and ones grouted with three strengths

## Which is Stronger – Concrete Blocks or Conventional Bricks 
 · Overall Strength. The Masonry Advisory Council states that the minimum compressive strength for concrete blocks is 1900 pounds per square inch. Although keep in mind dense blocks are often stronger than this. The Mechanical Properties of Unreinforced Brick Masonry reports that the average concrete block can handle around 3500 psi.

Testing of Concrete Masonry Blocks for Compressive. Oct 31 2016· Compressive Strength Tests on Concrete Masonry Blocks. Eight blocks are taken to determine the average compressive strength of concrete masonry block. The blocks should be tested with in 3days after collected in lab. The age of each block shall be 28 days.

## How do you calculate the compressive strength of a 
Read in-depth answer here. Then what is the compressive strength of a concrete block? The compressive strength of concrete masonry units and masonry walls varies from approximately 1000 psi (7 MPa) to 5000 psi (34 MPa) based on the type of concrete used to manufacture the unit stacking orientation the type of mortar used to build the wall and other factors.

## Eurocode 6: Design of Masonry Structures
 · 13. In Eurocode 6 the primary method of specifying mortar is by the strength grade. An M12 mortar should have a compressive strength at 28 days of 12 N/mm 2. This strength is used in the relationship to determine the characteristic compressive strength of the masonry.
