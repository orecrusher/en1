## Resistivity and Conductivity 
Resistivity vs. Temperature. Change in resistivity vs. temperature can be calculated as. dρ = ρ α dt (5) wheredρ = change in resistivity (ohm m 2 /m) α = temperature coefficient (1/ o C) dt = change in temperature (o C) Example - Change in Resistivity. Aluminum with resistivity 2.65 x 10-8 ohm m 2 /m is heated from 20 o C to 100 o C.

## Temperature Coefficient of Resistance 
 · The resistance-change factor per degree Celsius of temperature change is called the temperature coefficient of resistance. This factor is represented by the Greek lower-case letter "alpha" (α). A positive coefficient for a material means that its resistance increases with an increase in temperature.

## Q A: Brittleness of metals at low temperature 
 · Iron and steel components crumble more easily in a crusher at these temperatures and then the remaining pieces can be separated from non-iron components with magnets later on. Metals become brittle at temperatures much warmer than liquid nitrogen temperatures. On a cold winter night in Iowa the door on my brother's car was frozen shut.
