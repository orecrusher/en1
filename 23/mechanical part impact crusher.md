## Jaw Crushers 
Jaw crushers reduce large rocks or ore by means of compression. Mechanical pressure is applied using the crusher's two jaw; one is fixed while the other makes an eccentric movement. There are also primary and secondary types of these crushers. Jaw crushers are one of the most commonly preferred crushers due to their ability to crush all kinds

## Simulation of particle flows and breakage in crushers 
 · It is also very desirable for impact crushers since the rock size distribution can change rapidly and is quite different in different parts of the crusher. Here we use a replacement strategy breakage model from Cleary (2001c). Most particle breakage has been modelled in DEM by constructing the macro-particles from smaller sub-particles.

Impact crushers have fewer moving parts and less mechanical loss when compared to compression machines like cone crushers. In the past the limits on impact crushers have been their high cost to operate when the materials are hard and abrasive. Historically hard rocks such as granites quartzite and other materials with high abrasives
