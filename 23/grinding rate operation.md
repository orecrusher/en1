For high stock removal a slower head speed relative to a higher base speed produces the most aggressive grinding/ polishing operation. The drawback to high velocity distributions is that the abrasive (especially SiC papers) may not breakdown uniformly this can result in non-uniform removal across the specimen surface.

## The Significance of Crushing Roll Infeed Rate in the 
Summary. The infeed rate of the crushing roll during the wheel crushing process has a direct influence on the cycle time. It is shown that a grinding wheel has a characteristic crushing pressure which is independent of infeed rate and that the performance of the wheel is not influenced by infeed rate.

## Handbook of Machining with Grinding Wheels
Grinding once considered primarily a finishing operation involving low rates of removal has evolved as a major competi-tor to cutting as the term "abrasive machining" suggests. This is what Milton Shaw the man who is considered the great pioneer and father of American grinding said about 10 years ago.
