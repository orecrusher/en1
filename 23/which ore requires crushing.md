Liberation is the first step in processing crude taconite ore and consists mostly of crushing and grinding. The ore must be ground to a particle size sufficiently close to the grain size of the iron-bearing mineral to allow for a high degree of mineral liberation. Most of the taconite used today requires very fine grinding.
