## cadmium 
Some lead ores also contain small quantities of cadmium and if it is present in sufficient quantity it is recovered by a cycle of operations similar to that used by zinc smelters. Zinc producers who use the electrolytic process recover cadmium in a somewhat different way but again the principle is the same beginning with the roasting of zinc sulfide followed by the treatment of the flue
