## How does gear ratio affect Torque ~ Mechanical Engineering
Simply put torque at work (such as at a wheel) is your motor's torque times your gear ratio. Motor Torque x gear ratio = torque at the wheel. Lets say we have a 10rmps motor that is capable of 5 oz Torque (we know this from our motor spec.) Lets say we have 2 gears. Our input gear (attached to our motor) has 10 teeth Our output gear has 50 teeth.
