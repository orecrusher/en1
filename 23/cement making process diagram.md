## CONCRETE 
cement determines to a large extent how strong the hardened concrete will be. Most concretes are designed with a certain cement content and enough water to make the mass workable. Providing workability is adequate reducing.the mixing water content makes the batch stronger and the addition of water makes the batch weaker. 2.
