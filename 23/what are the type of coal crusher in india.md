## Distribution of Coal in India: Gondwana Coalfields 
 · Gondwana coal makes up to 98 per cent of the total reserves and 99 per cent of the production of coal in India. Satpuras denudation [weathering + erosion] has exposed coal bearing Gondwana strata. The carbon content in Gondwana coal [250 million years old] is less compared to the Carboniferous coal [350 million years old][Almost Absent in India] because of its much younger age.
