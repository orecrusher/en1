## Explain dry and wet process of cement manufacturing
 · The dry process for the manufacture of cement is preferred only in places where hard crystalline limestone and shales are available. The only advantage of this process is that the fuel consumption is low. The raw materials are first crushed together in the dry state in a multi-chamber tube mil of a fairly large diameter.
