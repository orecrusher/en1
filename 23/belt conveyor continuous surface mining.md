Further to countless belt conveyors installed globally in 2000 we built a conveyor system with the world`s longest 16.8 km single flight conveyor; of which16 km was inside an inclined tunnel. Other significant achievements in the development of conveyor systems are our installed downhill overland conveyors at El Abra and the in-pit and ex-pit conveyors of the Escondida mine in Chile.
