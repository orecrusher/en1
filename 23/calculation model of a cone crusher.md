## Aggregate Equipment Review – Cone Crushers: Direct Drive 
Cone crushers are critical pieces for aggregate production mineral processing operations and recycling appliions. They're typically a secondary or tertiary rock crusher and produce a fine or medium-sized aggregate material. Since cone crushers have a large feed opening and small discharge sizes this type of aggregate equipment has a high crushing ratio making them quite efficient on

## Dynamic modeling and simulation of cone crushing circuits 
Abstract As a common practice steady-state models are used for simulation and process dimensioning of crushing circuits. However intended circuit performance is rarely achieved due to constantly fluctuating feed-material size and characteristics. This gap between theoretical and realized performance has the potential for process control.
