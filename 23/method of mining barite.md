There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.

## Environmental Impact of Artesanal Mining of Barytes in 
Abstract: The name Azara has become synonymous with artesanal mining of baryte in Nigeria. This activity turned into a lucrative business immediately after the abandonment of the mechanized method of mining in the 80s. Ever since then the exploration of barite in Azara has been manual characterized by the use of primitive tools such as diggers and shovels usually on a small scale.
