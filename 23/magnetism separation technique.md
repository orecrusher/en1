## Separation Techniques 
Magnetic Separation. Magnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet. Magnetism is ideal for separating mixtures of two solids with one part having magnetic properties.

## What is magnetic separation? 
 · The magnetic separation is a physical separation technique which is based mixtures or using the magnetic properties of the material such as its sensitivity to the attraction or repulsion magnets. It is also known as magnetization because the objects that can be separated by this technique are magnetized by the magnetic field of the magnets.
