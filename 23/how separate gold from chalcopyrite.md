## How Gravity Separation Works to Recover Metals and Minerals
Gravity separation has been used for centuries to separate different minerals and metals based on their specific gravity. Some of the earliest recordings of this science in practice are from Ancient Egypt as workers panned for gold in the Nile river.

The Separation of Chalcopyrite and Pyrite. Method. It depends on the ore property including the following two methods: 1.1 Preferential Flotation: This method is suitable for dense lump ores. Under relatively coarse fineness chalcopyrite and pyrite can be fully dissociated and separated. Separation Turn: chalcopyrite first pyrite second.

## Pyrite 
Chalcopyrite vs. Gold. If you were to rub the mineral vigorously with a hard object then if pyrite it will give off a sulphurous smell (like rotten eggs) but if gold no odour will be apparent. As well if struck with a steel hammer gold will flatten or change shape without breaking but pyrite will give off sparks.

## Difference Between Pyrite and Chalcopyrite 
 · Key Difference – Pyrite vs Chalcopyrite Pyrite and chalcopyrite are both sulfide minerals but their chemical composition is different. The key difference between pyrite and chalcopyrite is that pyrite contains iron sulfide (FeS 2) whereas chalcopyrite contains sulfides of copper and iron (CuFeS 2).Despite having similar names and slightly similar chemical formula their chemical properties

Sulfide ores such as chalcopyrite sphaelerite galena and pyrrhotite and mixtures of these ores have historically been found with micron size gold particles included in them. This generally involves frother several collectors (promoters) and possibly some modifying or depressing agents as well.

In the presence of PGA selective separation between the two minerals was achieved at pH 9 and the recovery of chalcopyrite was over 85% and that of pyrite was less than 20%.

 · Chalcopyrite is softer and yellower than pyrite more brittle than gold. It is often mixed with pyrite. Chalcopyrite may have various amounts of silver in place of the copper gallium or indium in place of the iron and selenium in place of the sulfur. Thus these metals are all byproducts of copper production.

 · In the case of Chalcopyrite if there's gold buried in it you're going to have to do a spectrometer tests and find out what kinds of assay or do a full assay this material. One of the problems with sulfides is they're refractory. it's fancy word for means it really is formed high temperatures and it takes extremely high temperatures to break it back down.
