CNC machines are driven by computer aided design (CAD) programs which control most if not all functions require minimal operator input. Generally a milling machine operator runs the machine by feeding the material over a device called a milling cutter. As the material is fed past the cutter the cutter's teeth slice through the material to form the desired shape.
