The Types Of Coal Composition Usage And Energy Value. Hot air or fire gases are passed through the feeder to dry the coal before feeding to the pulverizer. The pulverized coal is carried from the mill with the help of primary air fan. This further carries the coal through short delivery pipe to the burner.

## Pulverised Coal 
Pieces of coal are crushed between balls or cylindrical rollers that move between two tracks or "races." The raw coal is then fed into the pulverizer along with air heated to about 330°C (650°F) from the boiler. As the coal gets crushed by the rolling action the hot air dries it and blows the usable fine coal powder out to be used as fuel.
