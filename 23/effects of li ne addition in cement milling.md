Hydration of the cement–pozzolana blend is generally more gradual than that of a pure cement although the filler effect can lead to an ever-so-slight acceleration of early age hydration. The pozzolanic reaction also leads to a lower heat evolution during hydration and a reduction in the portlandite content with increased production of C-S-H (with impliions for durability).
