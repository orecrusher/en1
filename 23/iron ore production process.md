 · EMERGING SCENARIO IN IRONMAKING More than 90% of world iron production is through Blast furnace technology route. Driving forces: Alternative Iron making technologies: Costly and scarce coking coal: Need to look beyond coking coal. Possibility to use iron ore fines directly. Environmental considerations. Eliminate pollution-intensive sintering and coke-making processes.

The world will need iron ore for as long as the world needs steel. In 2020 we produced around 280 million tonnes of iron ore. That's enough to make the steel for more than 3300 Sydney Harbour Bridges. We're building a new iron ore mine in Western Australia. When completed South Flank will produce high-quality iron ore for around 25 years.

In addition to the BF-BOF process there is another process which utilizes mainly scrap as an iron source with some direct reduced iron whenever necessary. The direct reduced iron is produced by reducing iron ore with reformed natural gas whose principal components are hydrogen carbon monoxide and methane.

In the DRI process iron ore in the form of lump or pellets is reduced to metallic iron in the solid state unlike in the BF where the material is melted. Today about 100 Mt of DRI is produced globally each year with the majority of that using reformed natural gas (essentially splitting natural gas into hydrogen and carbon monoxide) to strip away the oxygen from the iron ore.

For the production of steel there is a need for iron raw material in the form of iron ore or scrap metal together with alloying elements so that the material acquires the desired for properties. In the production of ore-based steel coal is also needed as a reducing agent and limestone as a slag former.

## Extraction of Iron Concentration of Ore 
 · Concentration of Ore. The extraction of iron begins with concentration through calcination which is a process in a limited supply of oxygen applied to ores to bring thermal decomposition. An ore of a metal is an impure source. It consists of many impurities other than metal such as sand clay etc.

Our heavy-duty iron ore balling drums are relied on by some of the industry's top producers to process iron ore fines into pellets for the steelmaking process. The use of a disc pelletizer is a popular alternative approach to pelletizing iron ore fines as this offers more control over pellet size and produces a more refined pellet product.
