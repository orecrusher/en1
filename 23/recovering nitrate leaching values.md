## Nitrate leaching and apparent recovery of urine
Nitrate leaching increased under urine patches with a significant effect of appliion date. This effect was not however consistent over the three years. Total recovery of N in grass and of mineral N in leachate and soil was generally less than the amount of urine-N applied with a balance deficit of 60-80% (field) or 10-70% (lysimeters).

Nitrate levels in the soil + Drainage from saturated soils Most crops prefer to take up nitrogen as nitrate. Having an available supply of nitrate when the plant needs it is an asset for the crop. Having too much nitrate in the soil can be a liability. Farmers can reduce leaching risk by matching their fertiliser appliions to the crop demand.
