In the process of ore enrichment by flotation requires about fifty cubic meters of water per ton of ore concentrate. The Kursk magnetic anomaly (KMA) where the radius of the depression funnel reached 80 km during 80 years of field operation can be cited as an example of mining and processing plant impact on the environment.

 · Although strong positive correlation among nickel copper and cobalt has been reported high-grade nickel ores are often closely correlated with cobalt rather than copper ores. Moreover as direct carriers of ore-forming elements nickel and cobalt minerals can be easily enriched through magma evolution hydrothermal process and weathering ( Zhao et al. 2019 ).

Nickel is difficult to be enriched from laterite nickel ore with mineral processing. The traditional processes used for manufacturing nickel need high energy consumption and yield a large amount of metallurgy waste residue. A new method was developed. Nickel and iron was enriched firstly by leaching laterite nickel ore in concentrated alkali solution.

Traditionally nickel has been processed from sulfide ores in an approach similar to copper processing in which the ore is upgraded to concentrates and then smelted. As sulfide ore resources dwindle however processing of lateritic nickel ores is becoming of greater necessity with many recognizing nickel laterite ores as the future of the nickel industry.

## What Is Nickel Smelting? (with picture) 
Alex Newth Nickel ore must melt until it becomes a product known as liquid matte which is usually around 45 percent nickel. Nickel smelting is the process that nickel ore goes through to eventually remove impurities and leave just the nickel metal. While the ores can come from different stones and sources they have two egories: lateritic or rocks found in tropical climates and which

 · Ferronickel enrichment and extraction from nickel laterite ore were studied through reduction and magnetic separation. Reduction experiments were performed using hydrogen and carbon monoxide as reductants at different temperatures (700–1000°C). Magnetic separation of the reduced products was conducted using a SLon-100 cycle pulsating magnetic separator (1.2 T).
