## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

We use a closed-circuit grinding process to obtain a very finely ground cement. A size particle range of 3 to 30 microns (one micron is a thousandth of a millimeter!) results in the most efficient hydration of cement and better strength properties including more late strength. The Wonder Cement factory process is now complete.
