## Gold Recovery And How To Choose The Right Process 
Gold deposits can be grouped into two primary classes: placer deposits where the gold is exposed from weathering and erosion and hard rock where the gold is still trapped within the host rock. Gold recovery methods for these two types of deposits vary greatly from simple panning to a complex network of grinding chemical leaching gravity concentration and more.

## Mining Technology in the Nineteenth Century 
Miners used mechanical crushing and grinding machines to break up ores for further processing. Early miners used Mexican arrastras or stamp mills which reached their peak in the late nineteenth century to crush ores into sand-size particles. Before going to stamp mills ores often went through rock crushers which were like nutcrackers.

## How gold is made 
Gold is obtained from lode deposits by drilling blasting or shoveling the surrounding rock. Lode deposits often run deep underground. To mine underground miners dig shafts into the ground along the vein. Using picks and small explosives they then remove the gold ore from the surrounding rock.
