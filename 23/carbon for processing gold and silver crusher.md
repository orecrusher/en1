 · The carbon has a very high affinity for the aurocyanide complex and adsorbs the gold out of solution resulting in very high loadings on the carbon (typically g/t). At the end of the leach the loaded carbon is removed from the slurry and the adsorbed gold is stripped out at high temperature and pressure with sodium hydroxide and cyanide solutions to form a high value electrolyte solution.
