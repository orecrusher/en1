## Iron Production 
 · Iron Production. The production of iron from its ore involves an oxidation-reduction reaction carried out in a blast furnace. Iron ore is usually a mixture of iron and vast quantities of impurities such as sand and clay referred to as gangue. The iron found in iron ores are found in the form of iron oxides. As a result of these impurities iron

## What Is Involved in Pig Iron Production? (with pictures)
Jessica Ellis Iron ore is combined with charcoal in a blast furnace to create pig iron. The process of pig iron production involves the combination of iron ore charcoal and an intermediary material known as a flux inside a blast furnace.As the materials combine with intense heat much of the iron ore melts creating a superheated liquid form.
