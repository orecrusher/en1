## Milling and Sintering Behavior of the Metal
The reaction-sintered alumina ceramics with low firing shrinkage were prepared from Al/Al2O3 powder mixture by attrition milling and the effect of milling characteristics of raw powders on reaction sintering was investigated. Powder mixtures of flaky shape Al with coarse alumina was much more effectively comminuted by the attrition milling than the mixtures of globular shape Al with coarse
