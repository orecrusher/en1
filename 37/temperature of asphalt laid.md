## Care and maintenance of newly laid asphalt surfaces – TTS 
Avoiding damage to newly laid asphalt surfacing. Newly laid tarmac is at greater risk to damage in its early life before the surface hardens over time. This risk is greater particularly in the Summer months when temperatures are at their highest. Damage can be caused by the use of ladders standing vehicles such as caravans motorbike stands etc.

## Temperature measurement in asphalt paving (Part I)
One very important factor for the quality of a road is the temperature of the asphalt with which the road is build. Since a long time this is not a secret anymore but experiences from the last years are showing correlations between some of the other important factors in road building (like compaction evenness segregation etc.) and the temperature.

Moreover is it OK to lay asphalt in the cold? Asphalt typically can't be placed when the temperature of the ground is below freezing because a cold foundation causes the asphalt to lose its heat which makes it practically impossible to reach sufficient compaction. Because of this laying new asphalt is out of the question if the ground is frozen. Also can it be too hot to lay asphalt?

Pros: It is pocket friendly; It reduces noise pollution

## High Temperatures and Asphalt Shingles 
 · High temperatures prematurely age asphalt shingles. Dark color shingles typically heat up from 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit above the ambient temperature. That means your asphalt shingles can reach temperatures of 160 degrees Fahrenheit on a 100-degree Fahrenheit day. The roofing shingles may remain at a sustained temperature of 160 degrees

 · When it arrives at the job site hot-mix asphalt is normally between 275 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit. For the initial rolling the temperature of the mix needs to be between 220 and 290 degrees Fahrenheit. If the mix temperature falls below approximately 185 degrees Fahrenheit before the final compaction it will be too stiff to compact properly.

## What is the ideal temperature to lay asphalt?
The central role of temperature in asphalt paving. The reason is nicely described by what some call the "goldilocks zone." To retain its compaction properties between the asphalt plant and being laid on the road the asphalt mix cannot be too hot or too cold. Its temperature has to be just right.
