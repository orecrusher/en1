## Deposition of Ores in Limestone
 · In conclusion: The ores of primary formation in the Tintic mines have been in most of the occurrences deposited from highly heated solutions by the metasomatic replacement of the limestone; only in relatively subordinate amount have the metallic sulphides been formed by crystalline growth in the rock or by crystallization in the interspaces of the ore-bodies.

The fourth class of gold ores comprises the gold-telluride group. The gold telluride ores occur with silver or with silver lead and antimony or as native gold accompanied by other tellurides. These ores are often sent direct to the smelters for treatment. A fifth type is the disseminated ore type. They are often low in grade but large.
