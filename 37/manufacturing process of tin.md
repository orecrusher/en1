Advantages: Bronze is an alloy consisting mainly of copper but the addition of other metals (usually tin) produces an alloy much harder than plain copper. Bronze resists corrosion and metal fatigue better and conducts heat and electricity better than most steels. Disadvantages: Bronzes are generally softer weaker and more expensive than steel.

## The Difference Between Aluminum Tin Can 
 · Tin is typically extracted from a mineral called cassiterite a compound of tin and oxygen. Tin's basic refining process makes it appealing for manufacturing. Tin also does not corrode easily which is why it is useful for cans. A modern tin can is actually made from steel coated with a very thin layer of tin to prevent the steel from corroding.
