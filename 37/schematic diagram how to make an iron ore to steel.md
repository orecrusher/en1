## Steel making process – ArcelorMittal
Steel is produced from iron ore or scrap. Iron ore is a mineral aggregate that can be converted economically into iron. The quality of the iron ore is mainly determined by its composition; a high iron content and low sulphur and phosphorus contents are favorable. Iron ore can be found all over the world but its iron

Iron and steel making by-products. As with all large-scale manufacturing processes the production or iron and steel generates by-products. On average the production of 1 tonne of steel results in 200 kg (EAF) to 400 kg (BF/BOF) of by-products. The main by-products produced during iron and crude steel production are slags (90%) dusts and sludges.

 · Steel is a discovery of the Iron Age a period that started around 1200 BCE. Iron ore was first mined in Central Asia and Europe and humans at this time used iron to make tools and weapons in a practice called ferrous metallurgy. Iron products evolved during this time beginning with blacksmiths producing wrought iron goods.

The copedent is the steel guitarist's way of saying "this is how I tune my instrument." It's a diagram showing where the pedals and levers are and what action they take on the strings. The reason the copedent exists for steel guitar and not other instruments is that unlike other instruments there is no standard tuning for the steel guitar.

## Infographic: the Iron and Steel Manufacturing Process
 · Steel is made primarily in a two-step process. In the primary steelmaking step liquid iron is converted into steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process or by melting scrap steel or direct reduced iron (DRI) in an electric arc furnace. Secondary steelmaking is a refining process in which alloying metals are added and impurities are removed.

## Creating Steel 
The open-hearth furnace is one way to create steel from pig iron. The pig iron limestone and iron ore go into an open-hearth furnace. It is heated to about 1600 degrees F (871 degrees C). The limestone and ore form a slag that floats on the surface. Impurities including carbon are oxidized and float out of the iron into the slag.

 · Metal is a great material to work with. It's rigid tough malleable and conductive but sometimes the part we need doesn't exist in any store. In order to create custom pieces you need to either melt the metal and cast it in a mold or heat it until it's soft enough to shape with your hammer. Properly melting metals can be a bit dangerous in our home shop but we can make a coffee can

 · Direct reduced iron (DRI) process. In addition to the process route via the blast furnace process there is another option for extracting crude steel from iron ores using the so-called direct reduced iron (DRI) process (secondary route).The starting point for the efforts to find an alternative to the blast furnace process was the relatively high process expenditure.

## The 6 Steps To Modern Steel Production Explained 
As iron is the main component of steel it firstly needs to be made. Iron ore lime and coke are placed into a blast furnace and melted. The resulting liquid known as molten iron is then formed. As molten iron still contains around 4% – 4.5% impurities such as carbon which in turn make the metal brittle they need to be eradied. Step 2
