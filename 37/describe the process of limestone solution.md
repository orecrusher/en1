## Processes of Chemical Weathering 
Solution weathering is the process by which certain minerals are dissolved by acidic solutions. For example calcite in limestone is dissolved easily by carbonic acid. Rain that percolates through cracks and fissures in limestone beds dissolves calcite making wider cracks that can ultimately develop into cave systems. Oxygen.

## Geological Society 
There are different types of chemical weathering the most important are: Solution - removal of rock in solution by acidic rainwater. In particular limestone is weathered by rainwater containing dissolved CO2 (this process is sometimes called carbonation). Hydrolysis - the breakdown of rock by acidic water to produce clay and soluble salts.

Limestone-Hydrochloric Acid Process Limestone can be treated with hydrochloric acid to form calcium chloride and carbon dioxide:If concentrated (36%) hydrochloric acid is utilised the concentration of CaCl 2 in the produced solution will be approximately 40% and further evaporation is only needed when flakes are produced.
