 · It is also very desirable for impact crushers since the rock size distribution can change rapidly and is quite different in different parts of the crusher. Here we use a replacement strategy breakage model from Cleary (2001c). Most particle breakage has been modelled in DEM by constructing the macro-particles from smaller sub-particles.
