Another steelmaking process widely used today is the electric furnace. The furnace charge is generally 100 percent scrap and an electric arc is used as the heat source for the refining process. The electric furnace is generally not used for deep drawing steel or very light gauge steel because of its inability to reduce the residual element levels typically found in ferrous scrap to the low

## Blog: Potential game changers for the future of steelmaking
 · Part of my speech focused on the growing global ferrous scrap availability and the innovative steelmaking technologies which are potential game changers for the future of steelmaking. In 2016 the steel industry used about 1.2 billion tonnes of blast furnace iron (hot metal) 520 million tonnes (Mt) of ferrous scrap and 75 Mt of direct reduced iron - to produce about 1.6 billion tonnes of

## The Physical Chemistry of Oxygen Steelmaking 
A survey of the chemical and thermal aspects of basic oxygen steelmaking as compared with other processes. The equilibria relationships for the basic open-hearth process studied over a 35 year period are equally valid for oxygen steelmaking. However the kinetics of the process are different. It is these similarities and differences which this article defines.

## The chemistry of steelmaking. The big picture.
Steels are usually treated in some way during their manufacture to slow down the rate at which rusting takes place. Iron is changed into steel by blowing oxygen through the molten metal from the Blast Furnace. This oxidises the impurities in the molten metal.

## Steelmaking and Refining 
Modern steelmaking processes are broken into two egories: primary and secondary steelmaking. Primary steelmaking uses mostly new iron as the feedstock usually from a blast furnace. Secondary steelmaking is performed in an electric arc furnace and uses scrap steel as the primary raw material. Refining consists of purifying an impure metal.

## Steps in the Modern Steelmaking Process
 · Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures oxygen is blown through the metal which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

## A Short History of Steel and the Bessemer Process
 · Blister steel—one of the earliest forms of steel —began production in Germany and England in the 17th century and was produced by increasing the carbon content in molten pig iron using a process known as cementation. In this process bars of wrought iron were layered with powdered charcoal in stone boxes and heated.
