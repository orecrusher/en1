5. Screw conveyors can be used to cool heat or dry products during transit process. Depending on the heat transfer requirements it can be jacketed or a hollow-flight design utilized to provide the necessary heat transfer for the appliion. 6. Screw conveyors can be designed to be vapor-tight or hold an internal pressure.

## Screw conveyor 
A screw conveyor or auger conveyor is a mechanism that uses a rotating helical screw blade called a "flighting" usually within a tube to move liquid or granular materials.They are used in many bulk handling industries. Screw conveyors in modern industry are often used horizontally or at a slight incline as an efficient way to move semi-solid materials including food waste wood chips

## Screw conveying 
The modern screw conveyor is essentially a development of the well-known Archimedean screw which was conceived some 2000 years ago as a means of raising water for irrigation. Appliions of this device were naturally very limited until relatively recent times and its evolution has consequently been slow.

## Developing screw conveyor flight (flat pattern) 
 · Developing screw conveyor flight (flat pattern) I have been working on a screw conveyor and of course the flights. I was told that using the Coil tool in Inventor would not allow the flight to be unfold as a sheet metal part. After a bit on research online that seems to be a common problem and many people are drawing the flat pattern separately.

Above 45-degrees an inclined screw conveyor is considered a vertical screw conveyor and must be designed in accordance with the KWS Engineering Guide for Vertical Screw Conveyors. As the degree of incline increases conveying efficiency is reduced and horsepower requirements increase due to the effects of gravity and bulk material fall back.
