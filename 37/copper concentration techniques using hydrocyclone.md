## Use of Hydrocyclones for Mammalian Cell Retention 
 · A hydrocyclone with a volume of 2.56 cm 3 was studied as a potential cell retention device for mammalian cell cultures (6 L volume). For the feasible operation range (0.9 to 1.6 L/min flow corresponding to pressure drops of 0.4 to 1.3 bar) the hydrocyclone was characterized with regard to flow split (underflow‐to‐overflow ratio) and flow ratio (underflow to supply).
