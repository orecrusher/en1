The sediment basin components and methodology utilised for Type A and B basins should always be adopted wherever practical. Even without a treatment system the design approach promotes more effective settling compared to Type D basins that do not normally incorporate automatic dosing forebays and hydraulically efficient settling pond designs.

Settling basins •Smaller retention ponds often used before the lagoon to capture and "settle out" larger and more dense solids from the flushed manure. Slows sludge buildup in the main lagoon. •Liquid (and some solids) flow from the settling basin to the lagoon •When full the solids are removed and applied to cropland (usually preplant)

Two criteria are used for the purpose of calculating the surface area of a settling tank : the hydraulic surface loading that is characteristic of the volume of water that can be processed by the unit of surface area and unit of time (m 3 ·m –2.h –1);; the solids loading that is characteristic of suspended solids that will settle per unit of surface area and per unit of time (kg · m –2

The aquaculture industry is facing important challenges to its continued development and growth. The challenges will require that more efficient and environmentally benign culture methods be developed. Issues related to reductions in energy and water use in the culture of aquatic species need to be addressed. New species may be cultured for economic or environmental reasons and appropriate
