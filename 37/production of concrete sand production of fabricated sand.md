 · The production of cement is reported by 150 countries and reached 3.7 billion tonnes in 2012 (USGS 2013a). For each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS 2013b). Thus the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year
