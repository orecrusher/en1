Sodium cyanideSodium gold cyanide. Sodium cyanide is used mainly to extract gold and other precious metals in mining industry. This appliion exploits the high affinity of gold(I) for cyanide which induces gold metal to oxidize and dissolve in the presence of air (oxygen) and water producing the salt sodium gold cyanide (or gold sodium cyanide) and sodium hydroxide:
