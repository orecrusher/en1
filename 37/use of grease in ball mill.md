 · Grease is a combination of a thickener and base oil. The oil type can be mineral or synthetic. When used grease clings to the internal bearing components releasing or bleeding oil onto the moving components. In grease lubriion oil is still providing the critical lubriion function. The thickener is just the media holding the oil.
