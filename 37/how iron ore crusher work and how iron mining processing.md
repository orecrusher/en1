Mined right out of the ground raw ore is mix of ore proper and loose earth called gangue. The ore proper can usually be separated by crushing the raw ore and simply washing away the lighter soil. Breaking down the ore proper is more difficult however as it is a chemical compound of carbonates hydrates oxides silies sulfides and various impurities.

 · The principal iron ores contain hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). Hematite is an iron oxide mineral. It is non-magnetic and has colour variations ranging from steel silver to reddish brown. Pure hematite contains 69.9% Fe by molecular weight. It has been the dominant iron ore mined in Australia since the early 1960s.
