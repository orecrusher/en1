## Metallurgical coal 
Metallurgical coal is a primary ingredient in the steel making process. It takes around 770 kilograms of coal to make one ton of steel. Approximately 70% of global steel is produced in basic oxygen blast furnaces. The majority of steel is used in: Construction: like buildings bridges and infrastructure. Transport: like ships planes and trains.

 · Surface mining methods are widely used to excavate coal and their efficiency greatly depends on the depth of a given coal seam. This method can recover up to 90% of the coal found on the upper surface. Large-scale surface mining of coal requires huge areas and mining equipment such as shovels dumpers draglines and conveyors.

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal gold or iron ore.Iron ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times. Prehistoric people first mined flint which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

First of all the layer of earth – overburden – above the first coal seam has to be removed. (The seam can be up to 200 meters below the surface.) All the earth around the base of the seam is removed before extraction begins. When the hole is large enough the miners dig down to the next layer of coal.

Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.

 · There are two basic types of mining: mining underground and mining at the earth's surface. Nearly two-thirds of the world's solid minerals are mined through surface mining. It is especially predominant in obtaining items such as coal copper sand gravel crushed stone iron aluminum and phosphates.

Surface mining can be used when the coal is buried less than 200 feet underground. In surface mining the topsoil and layers of rock are removed to expose large deposits of coal. The coal is then removed by huge machines. Once the mining is finished the Coal How Coal Was Formed

## Strip Mining 
Surface mine design principles emanate from the operational characteristics of surface mining which are drilling and blasting spoil handling coal removal and haulage. Except in a few circumstances overburden in surface mining requires the rock to be fractured by explosives to allow it to be excavated.

Surface mining at these scales is more economical for coal companies safer for miners and coal operators say essential for mining the thin seams of lower-sulfur coal more valuable in today's market. With dynamite and immense machines surface mines can produce more than two to three times as much coal per miner as underground mines can.

## Mining and Mineral Use 
Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earth's surface. Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores. How underground mining is approached – from above below or sideways – depends on the placement of the ore body its depth concentration of ore and the strength of the surrounding rock.

 · The mine will extend from this initial spot in all directions. 4. Open cast mining. Also known as open pit mining this is a method of surface mining where a large pit is made in the ground and the coal is mined directly from that pit. This is a great method to use for a shallow coal seam and it is extremely productive.

## Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation 
Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation. Surface coal mining involves disturbing overlying rock layers (overburden) to expose and extract coal reserves using the area mining method wherein the overburden above the uppermost coal seam and the innerburden between the lower coal seams are removed in parallel strips (pits) across the coalfield until the area is mined.

 · This region has large underground mines and small surface mines. Coal mined in the Appalachian coal region is primarily used for steam generation for electricity metal production and for export. Coal is used to create almost half of all electricity generated in the United States. Power plants burn coal to make steam.

In Tennessee the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) has operated a Federal regulatory program as the primary regulator under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) since October 1984 when the State repealed its surface mining law. OSMRE also has regulatory authority responsibilities for surface coal mining activities in the states of Georgia
