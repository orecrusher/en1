## Gradation Techniques 
Over the years many different aggregate proportioning techniques have been used to create a concrete mixture. Aggregate can be proportioned by volume minimum voids and gradation. Furthermore a well designed and economical mixture will effectively use the aggregate to reduce the amount of paste in a mixture but still achieve the required workability which is called optimized graded concrete.
