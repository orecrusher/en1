## Fine coal processing with dense medium cyclones
Beneficiation of fine coal nominally below 0.5 mm with dense-medium cyclones was implemented as long ago as 1957 and cyclones are still being used to process fine coal today but the history shows that the appliion of cyclones in fine coal processing has not been nearly as successful as in the processing of coarser coal.
