Double-roll crushers are able to crush more finely than single-roll crushers because they are designed with teeth that mesh together rather than rotating past a smooth plate. They can reduce coal to as little as ¼ inch (0.6 cm) topsize although they are more commonly operated close to 2 inches (5 cm).

The sized coal from the Rotary Breaker can then be fed into a Rolling Ring Crusher which produces a finer product. For more specific and smaller sizing of the coal the Double Roll Crusher is generally the preferred machine particularly for processing the sizes required by power stations and for the export market where tight specifiions are required.

Rotary Dryer – A rotary dryer can be used however the generation of fines is high. These are vey low RPM dryers and hence the drying is inconsistent i.e. the dried coal does not have uniform moisture. Tornesh or Flash Dryer – Maximum particle size limited to 6 mm. Though dryers are cheap the crushing of coal to lower sizes cannot be avoided.

 · When selecting a crusher the physical properties of the raw materials must be fully considered. Generally for materials with obvious plastic deformation it is preferable to adopt a combination of extrusion and shearing in a static load transmission mode and it is suitable to use a single-tooth roller or a double-tooth roller crusher.
