## Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) 
 · Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is a by-product from the blast-furnaces used to make iron. furnaces are fed with a controlled mixture of iron-ore coke and limestone and operated at a temperature of about 1500°C.The granulated slag is further processed by drying and then grinding in a vertical roller mill of rotating ball mill to a very fine powder which is GGBS.

## Alkali
Alkali-Aggregate Reaction. In most concrete aggregates are more or less chemically inert. However some aggregates react with the alkali hydroxides in concrete causing expansion and cracking over a period of many years. This alkali-aggregate reaction has two forms: alkali-silica reaction (ASR) and alkali-carbonate reaction (ACR).

The ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is a by-product of iron manufacturing which when added to concrete improves its properties such as workability strength and durability. This material is obtained by the heating of iron ore limestone and coke at a temperature about 1500 degree Celsius. The process is carried out in a blast furnace.
