The depth of cut is adjusted by rotating the vertical feed screw of the table. Straddle Milling. When two or more parallel vertical surfaces are machined at a single cut the operation is called straddle milling.

## End Mills! (Your questions answered)
There are end mills designed specifically for aluminum. They usually have a steep rake angle on the helix and have only two flutes. This is to take advantage of higher speeds and feeds that industrial machines can run at with aluminum i.e. very fast. A carbide end mill designed for machining aluminum.
