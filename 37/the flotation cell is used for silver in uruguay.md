## Effects of silver in water 
 · Silver has been used in the United States for water disinfection since the 1950s and numerous commercial water filters using silver are currently being marketed today. Household filter systems using ceramic filters coated in the anti-bacterial agent colloidal silver have been shown to be effective in eliminating bacteria in contaminated water in various loions around the world.
