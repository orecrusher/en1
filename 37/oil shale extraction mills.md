## Oil Extraction 
Oil extraction for biofuel production from edible oils such as palm oil sunflower oil canola oil or soybean oil could be questionable since it affects directly the food supply. Microalgae oil has appeared as a new feedstock for the production of biodiesel as well as bioethanol biosynthesis gas or bio-oil through thermochemical and biochemical processes (Lopresto et al. 2017).
