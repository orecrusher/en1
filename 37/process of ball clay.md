## Measuring the plasticity of clays: A review 
 · In traditional clay containing ceramic materials the measurement and control of the plasticity are needed to characterize the system and to optimize the conditions of the processing (Ribeiro et al. 2005). Factors influencing plasticity may be related to the clay itself or to the molding process (Henry 1943 Carman 1949 Marshall 1955).

 · Cover the clay with warm water and allow it to break down overnight – this process is called slaking down. The water should completely cover the clay. 2. Siphon off the excess water covering the clay. The easiest way to do this is to use a slip trailer but any soft squeezy bottle would work if you don't have a trailer.

## What is Ball Clay? 
Ball clay is an extremely rare mineral found in very few places around the world. Its name dates back to the early methods of mining when specialized hand tools were used to extract the clay in rough cube shapes of about 30 cm. As the corners were knocked through handling and storage these cubes became rounded and 'ball' shaped.
