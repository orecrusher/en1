## Rotary Vacuum Filter 
A rotary drum vacuum filter (RDVF) is a continuous filter wherein the solid constituent in a pulp or slurry is separated. Mechanism: Separation is done by a porous filter cloth or other media rotated through the pulp or slurry with vacuum applied to the inner surface to cause the solids to accumulate on the surface as a cake or layer through which the liquid is drawn.
