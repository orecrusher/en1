What is boiler? It is an enclosed pressure vessel in which water is converted into steam by gaining heat from any source (coal oil gas etc). Boiler in thermal power plant accumulates the steam and build up a pressure to expend it in turbine and convert thermal energy to mechanical energy. The generator which is connected to turbine converts the mechanical energy into electric energy.
