## Valves for gold production with CIL CIP or CIC circuits 
Contact. The nature and chemistry of an ore deposit determine the processing method used in gold production. There are many processing techniques for gold ore. The most common is cyanidation in carbon-in-leach (CIL) carbon-in-pulp (CIP) or carbon-in-column (CIC) circuits. Neles™ has a wide range of valves ideal for CIL CIP and CIC processing.
