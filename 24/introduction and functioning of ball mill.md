## Milling Process Defects Equipment 
End milling - An end mill makes either peripheral or slot cuts determined by the step-over distance across the workpiece in order to machine a specified feature such as a profile slot pocket or even a complex surface contour.The depth of the feature may be machined in a single pass or may be reached by machining at a smaller axial depth of cut and making multiple passes.

## Principle and Working of MILLING MACHINE 
 · Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling slotting making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.

 · Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed the overall removal is quite brisk.

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
