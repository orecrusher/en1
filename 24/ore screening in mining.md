Many of the particles encountered in mining are characterized by sieves (classifiers). Recent advances in computers cameras and software make image analysis practical for samples with sizes larger than several microns in diameter. As particle size decreases sieving and/or dynamic image analysis becomes more arduous or impossible and laser diffraction becomes the technique of choice.

 · Ore sorting in mining is usually considered a preconcentration method of upgrading run-of-mine ore before another beneficiation process. Ore sorting is a dry process primarily used for very coarse particles. In general laboratory testing on column cells has not been a reliable method of predicting full-scale plant operation.

## GEOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS IN MINING
GPR has numerous appliion in mining such as; investigation of hang wall thickness rock fractures potholes ore zone exploration (Francke 2012) and old mine (Galdón et al. 2017b). However it works well for shallow mineral investigation because its depth of penetration is very small compare to other geophysical methods and requires higher radar frequencies to get good resolution.
