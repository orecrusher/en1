The role of the electrode is to conduct electricity and convert electrical energy into heat. Electrodes are divided into three types: carbon electrodes graphite electrodes and self-baking electrodes according to their use and production process.In submerged arc furnaces self-baking electrodes are mainly used but when producing ferroalloy products with lower carbon content such as

## A Study of the Performance of Submerged Arc Furnace 
 · The consumption of energy and carbonaceous reductants is one of the more important factors that significantly influence the cost of industrial silicon production. The effect of raw materials on the silicon yield and the energy consumption in the process of producing silicon was investigated in this study using data collected from various submerged arc furnaces.

 · Arc furnaces differ from induction furnaces in that the charge material is directly exposed to an electric arc and the current in the furnace terminals passes through the charged material. For steelmaking direct current (DC) arc furnaces are used with a single electrode in the roof and the current return through a conductive bottom lining or conductive pins in the base.
