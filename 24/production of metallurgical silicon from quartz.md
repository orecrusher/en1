## production of metallurgical silicon from quartz
Metallurgical-Grade Silicon Production Quartz sand is reduced with carbon in an electric arc furnace at temperatures > 1900°C to metallurgical grade silicon (> 98 % pure). The major part of the world production (2008: approx. 6 million tons) is used for manufacturing alloys with aluminium and steel and as raw material for polysiloxane production.

## Our Silicon Production Process 
Our Process. The basic process for producing silicon has remained unchanged for decades: quartz or gravel (SiO2) is blended with a carbon source and superheated in a submerged arc furnace. As the mix heats the carbon reacts with the oxygen in the quartz and forms CO gas thereby reducing the quartz to 99% silicon in molten form.

## Production Rate of SiO Gas from Industrial Quartz and Silicon
 · The production rate of SiO gas from industrial quartz and silicon has been investigated by isothermal heat treatment experiments. Mixtures of silicon and different quartz samples have been heated to temperatures ranging from 1650 °C to 1950 °C and held for 30 to 120 minutes before cooling. The weight loss of each sample has been correlated to degree of reaction and a model for the reaction

Silicon metal or metallurgical silicon production involves a number of highly specialised and complex processes using Quartz and coal as the main raw materials. Silicon metal production is also highly energy intensive. Through further processes to increase purity levels silicon metal can be converted to chemical grade or photovoltaic silicon.
