## The Properties and Appliions of Platinum
 · Extracting platinum from ore is both capital and labor-intensive. It can take up to 6 months and 7 to 12 tons of ore to produce one troy ounce (31.135g) of pure platinum. The first step in this process is to crush platinum containing ore and immerse it in the reagent containing water; a process known as 'froth flotation'.
