The gold and silver discovered thus far have been found in epithermal deposits which are typically small in size but high in concentration of minerals. These types of deposits are likely caused by the circulation of sub-surface water which breaks down organic compounds in the soil and mineralises them--converting organic matter into inorganic substances like gold and silver.

## How Minerals Become Concentrated 
Mineral resources concentrated by running water are called placer deposits. Heavy substances such as gold ore require fast river currents to remain suspended in the flowing water.

 · Gold was precipitated during folding with fluid-flow concentrated along bedding as fold limbs rotated and hosted by bedding-parallel veins and associated structures. However the gold is sporadically developed often with subeconomic grades and is associated with quartz muscovite chlorite carbonates pyrrhotite and pyrite.

## Prospecting Encyclopedia: Geology of how Gold Deposits 
In gold-bearing country prospectors look for placer gold deposits where coarse sands and gravel have accumulated and where "black sands" are concentrated and settled in the stream. Typical examples of these types of loions for heavy material accumulations include the inside bends of rivers and streams as well as areas downstream from outcropping sections of bedrock or large boulders.

## Why is gold found only in certain 
Gold can be found in volcanic regions like plate boundaries. They are also moved around the earth by plate tectonics folding subduction uplift etc. and found in sedimentary mineral deposits called Placer deposits. A Placer is a deposit of heavy minerals concentrated by mechanical means. A good example of this is in rivers and streams.

Impure gold as it commonly occurs in deposits has a density of 16 to 18 whereas the associated waste rock (gangue) has a density of about 2.5. The differ-ence in density enables gold to be concentrated by gravity and permits the separation of gold

## petrology 
So what you are asking is: "How did gold become so concentrated in certain parts of the world?" So yes gold is all around but the concentration is too low to make extraction of it worthwhile. You need some process to take small amounts of gold from a large volume and turn it into large amounts of gold in a small volume where it is convenient to build a mining facility and get it from the Earth.

## Gold 
Primary gold occurrences are termed lode deposits. Mineralized rock and gold- bearing veins release gold particles during the weathering process. Because of its high specific gravity and resistance to weathering these sedimen- tary gold particles are easily concentrated by streams and rivers to form placer gold deposits.
