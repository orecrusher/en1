## What are the main components of the jaw crusher 
 · 4. bearings: The jaw crusher bearing is a plain bearing cast with babbitt. With the improvement of the technical level of rolling bearing manufacturing rolling bearings will be used in the jaw crusher in the future. The bearing bush of the main bearing and the connecting rod is overheated and can be cooled by circulating water.

## Gyratory Crushers 
 · The crushing action is much the same in principle as that of a jaw crusher the lumps of ore being pinched and broken between the crushing head and the bowl instead of between two jaws. The main point of difference between the two types is that the gyratory crusher does effective work during the whole of the travel of the head whereas the other only crushes during the forward stroke.

This paper sets out to perform a static force analysis of the single toggle jaw crusher mechanism and to obtain the force transmission characteristics of the mechanism. In order to obtain force transmission metrics that are characteristic of the structure of the mechanism such influences as friction dead weight and inertia are considered to be extraneous and neglected.
