## mine crushing in mineral processing 
· Crushing is an important step in the complex process of mineral processing (Fig. 1). In open pit mines rock chunks with edge lengths of 2 m have to be processed. In underground mines the biggest chunk sizes are about 0.5 m. Crushers have the task of reducing the ore rock to particle sizes in the millimetre range for subsequent grinding.

 · First the rock will enter the crushing chamber and drop as far as the angle of the crushing surface will allow it to. The crusher "breaks it and the fine material produced will drop through the gap between the mantle and the liner as it opens. The coarse material that can't fall through will remain to be crushed with the next gyration.
