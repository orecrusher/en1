## Copper Cement Oxidation 
 · Cement copper is usually a crude product containing elemental copper copper and iron oxides and impurities derived from the scrap iron. Most cement copper is smelted with copper sulfide flotation concentrates in a reverberatory furnace and consequently a product containing as much as 90 percent copper is refined along with material containing about 27 percent copper.

## Corrosion of Embedded Materials 
Corrosion is an electrochemical process involving the flow of charges (electrons and ions). At active sites on the bar called anodes iron atoms lose electrons and move into the surrounding concrete as ferrous ions. This process is called a half-cell oxidation reaction or the anodic reaction and is represented as: 2Fe → 2Fe 2+ + 4e-
