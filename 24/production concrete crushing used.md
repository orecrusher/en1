## What is Crushed Aggregate? (with pictures)
Impact crushers are used to created crushed rock aggregate. The different aggregate sizes and types are appropriate for specific uses in the construction and landscaping industries. For example although the larger coarse crushed aggregates are more economical this type of aggregate can present problems if used in concrete forms for upright structures.

## Impact Crusher 
Jaw crushers are mainly used for primary crushing as it can crush oversized concrete pieces into comparable size for secondary crushing. Impact crushers are preferred for secondary crushing as they produce a better quality of aggregate with less adhered mortar content [24].

## The History of Concrete 
Before Portland cement was discovered and for some years afterward large quantities of natural cement were used which were produced by burning a naturally occurring mixture of lime and clay. Because the ingredients of natural cement are mixed by nature its properties vary widely. Modern Portland cement is manufactured to detailed standards.

## How concrete block is made 
The concrete commonly used to make concrete blocks is a mixture of powdered portland cement water sand and gravel. This produces a light gray block with a fine surface texture and a high compressive strength. A typical concrete block weighs 38-43 lb (17.2-19.5 kg).

The crushing characteristics of hardened concrete are similar to those of natural rock and are not significantly affected by the grade or quality of the original concrete. Recycled concrete aggregates produced from all but the poorest quality original concrete can be expected to pass the same tests required of conventional aggregates.

 · Though "cement" and "concrete" are often used interchangeably concrete is actually the final product made from cement. The primary component of cement is limestone. To produce cement limestone and other clay-like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400°C and then ground to form a lumpy solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement.

 · Cement - Cement - Extraction and processing: Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones slates and some shales with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.
