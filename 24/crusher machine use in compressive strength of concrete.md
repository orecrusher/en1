## What is Compression Testing? 
Compression testing is one of the most fundamental types of mechanical testing alongside tensile and flexion tests. Compression tests are used to determine a material's behavior under applied crushing loads and are typically conducted by applying compressive pressure to a test specimen (usually of either a cuboid or cylindrical geometry) using platens or specialized fixtures on a universal
