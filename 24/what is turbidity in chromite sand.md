 · SpheriChrome is chromite that's unlike any other such sand available according to IMC because of the natural roundness of its grains and the narrow particle size. Those two factors mean the sand is ideal for producing molds and cores that bond better with lower binder content according to Dan Smith the chief operating officer at the Oregon operation.
