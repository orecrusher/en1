## Dolomite Mineral 
Dolomite serves as the host rock for many lead zinc and copper deposits. These deposits form when hot acidic hydrothermal solutions move upward from depth through a fracture system that encounters a dolomitic rock unit. These solutions react with the dolomite which causes a drop in pH that triggers the precipitation of metals from solution.
