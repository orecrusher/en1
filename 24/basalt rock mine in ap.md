## Geology 
Basalt Basalt is a mafic extrusive rock is the most widespread of all igneous rocks and comprises more than 90% of all volcanic rocks. Because of its relatively low silica content basalt lava has a comparatively low viscosity and forms thin flows that can travel long distances.

## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals 
 · Rock density is very sensitive to the minerals that compose a particular rock type. Sedimentary rocks (and granite) which are rich in quartz and feldspar tend to be less dense than volcanic rocks. And if you know your igneous petrology you will see that the more mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) a rock is the greater its density.

Rocks are made of minerals. They can be made of a single mineral or a combination of several minerals. There are three main types of rocks: 1) Igneous (IG-nee-us) rocks are formed from hot molten rock called magma. Granite and basalt are examples of igneous rocks. 2) Sedimentary rocks are formed from bits and pieces of rock which have broken off.
