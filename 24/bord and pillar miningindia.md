Bord And Pillar Coal Mining Ppt. Conventional bord and pillar mining in thick seams is associated with very low percentage of extraction around 30 in a panel even under favourable conditions.Extensive development of pillars carried out earlier in thick seams had also resulted in large reserves of good quality coal locked up in developed bord and pillar workings over 2500.
