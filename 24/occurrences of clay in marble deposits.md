Clay is a type of fine-grained natural soil material containing clay minerals. Clays develop plasticity when wet due to a molecular film of water surrounding the clay particles but become hard brittle and non–plastic upon drying or firing. Most pure clay minerals are white or light-coloured but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities such as a reddish or brownish colour
