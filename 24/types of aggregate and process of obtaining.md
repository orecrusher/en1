## A Detailed Guide on Grading of Aggregates.
The aggregate sample is sieved through a set of sieves and weights retained on each sieve in percentage terms are summed up. On dividing this sum by 100 The Fineness Modulus of that aggregate is determined. This helps in deciding about the quantity of aggregates of known fineness moduli to be mixed for obtaining a concrete of desired density.
