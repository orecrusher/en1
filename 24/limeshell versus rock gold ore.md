## What's the most efficient Minecraft mining strategy? 
 · Mining. Branch mining is the most efficient. There's a mathematical analysis on it in the official forums (the link is to an archive of the post).. Here's a brief description of branch mining: You dig down to the bedrock because that's where you're going to find the most different kinds of stuff.

## Green Energy Reality Check: It's Not as Clean as You Think 
 · That is a reality for all elements expressed by geologists as an ore grade: the percentage of the rock that contains the sought-after element. While ore grades vary widely copper ores typically contain only about a half-percent by weight of the element itself: thus roughly 200 tons of ore are dug up moved crushed and processed to get to one ton of copper.

## How to profit from low
 · High-grade gold contained in narrow veins that snake through the rock can only be mined by excavating shafts and hoisting the ore to surface via low tunnels (drifts). This process is expensive because digging deep requires a lot of material to be removed around the veins so that the mining equipment can access them.

 · The rock needs to be such that both the ore body and the host rock fracture under controlled conditions. Since the mined-out area is not back-filled the hanging wall keeps caving into the voids. The amount of developmental work involved with sublevel caving is significantly more as compared to other mining methods.

## Difference Between Ore and Mineral 
 · Ore. Ores contain minerals in a form of rock. Mostly ores contain minerals with metal elements. For example there are iron ores magnesium ores gold ores etc. Sometimes the metals are present as elements (not forming compounds) in ores and in some ores compounds like oxides sulfides silies are found.

## How Does Gold Look Like In Rocks 
The mineral-bearing the gold is known as the ore. Using visual inspection alone to ascertain if it is gold can be quite difficult or nearly impossible. This largely depends on the gold concentration within the rock. Several ores that contain the gold are also known to contain some other metals within them as well.
