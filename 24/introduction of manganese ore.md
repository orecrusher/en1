## Ores and Minerals 
First ores are crushed and grinded and then gauge or matrix is removed from the powdered ore. This is called concentration of ores. Ores of highly moderately and low reactive metals are 1 st concentrated. This step is common for ores of all types of metals. It is carried out by various methods depending upon the nature of the ore.

## The early history of manganese and the recognition of its 
Magnetic separation techniques allowed the extraction of zinc from mixed ore also containing iron and manganese leading to exploitation of a unique source of high manganese-content ore found in New Jersey. Not long after that technology's introduction in 1912 Casamajor reported the first U.S. cases of manganism detailing classic findings.

## Manganese 
Introduction. Manganese is an essential trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Manganese is a cofactor for many enzymes including manganese superoxide dismutase arginase and pyruvate carboxylase [12].Through the action of these enzymes manganese is involved in amino acid cholesterol glucose and carbohydrate metabolism; reactive

## Manganese 
Manganese ore containing 20% or more manganese has not been produced domestically since 1970. Manganese ore was consumed mainly by six firms with plants principally in the East and Midwest. Most ore consumption was related to steel production either directly in pig iron manufacture or indirectly through upgrading the ore to ferroalloys.
