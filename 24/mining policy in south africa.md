## Mining in SA 
In many ways South Africa's political social and economic landscape has been dominated by mining given that for so many years the sector has been the mainstay of the South African economy. Although gold diamonds platinum and coal are the most well-known among the minerals and metals mined South Africa also hosts chrome vanadium titanium and a number of other lesser minerals.

mining sectors to aggregate output in the South African economy rather than with the aggregate volume of sales of the sector.4 Over the period the proportional contribution of the mining sector to total value added in the South African economy has more than halved declining from 21.3% in1970 to 9.9% of the private sector's GDPin 1998.

## mining policy in south africa 
South Africa must take some bold steps in mining policy. What South Africa needs is a completely new mindset to be developed in mining policy formulation and we need to develop policies which create an environment that frees up the sector in such a way that positive actions are encouraged rather than ones which impose regulatory hurdles that are difficult and costly to attain.

## African Agency in Mineral Resource Governance 
 · Africa accounts for around 30 percent of the world's mineral resources but attracts only around 15 percent of global exploration spend. For international mining companies and investors 'African agency' is often synonymous with state intervention resource nationalism and risk amid unquestionable opportunity.

## Women and mine closure: A case study of policy in South Africa
 · The South African literature on closure has mostly used urban case studies to reveal the many aspects of mine closure ( Binns and Nel 2001; Marais 2013a 2013b; Nel and Binns 2002; Siyongwana 2018 ). Against this background the paper analyses South African mining policy and policy guidelines on the relationship between mine closure and women.

## Social disruption mine closure and housing policy 
 · Mine decline thus brought with it some form of social disruption. Whereas mining companies in Australia have attempted to minimise the social disruption caused by mine closure by introducing fly-in-fly-out arrangements the post-apartheid housing policy in South Africa has focused on asset building in mining areas.

## How should mining policy change? 
 · But South Africa's mining policy meets none of these criteria. This is the key reason why even during global commodities boom and despite South Africa's unparalleled mining wealth the country's mining industry shrank even as the mining sectors in other important jurisdictions expanded by 5% a year on average.

## The effects of policy on mining in South Africa
 · South Africa's mineral policy interventions over the past two decades have had a detrimental effect on the economic contribution and performance of the sector. Furthermore these interventions have failed to deliver some of its key socio-economic objectives – the overall efficacy of South Africa's volatile mineral policy has been low.
