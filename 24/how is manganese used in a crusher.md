## Manganese Ore 
Manganese ore is required in iron making to control the manganese content of the hot metal in the desired range. Unlike other plants where manganese ore lump is used directly in blast furnace in VSP it was proposed to use manganese ore fines in sinter productions. This would ensure much more consistent manganese content in the hot metal.
