## Cement Rotary Kiln 
Cement rotary kiln is used for calcination clinker from limestone clay etc to produce cement. Cement production should go through "two grinding process and one burning process" (that is raw material grinding system clinker calcining system and cement grinding system). Among them clinker calcining system is a thermal process that burned cement raw meal into cement clinker at high temperature
