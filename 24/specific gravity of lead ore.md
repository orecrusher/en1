## Specific Gravity 
 · Since specific gravity is relative to the weight of an object in air and its weight in water it is a ratio and isn't expressed in units (such as kg/m³). For instance the SG of Diamond = 3.52 (whereas the density of Diamond = 3.52 g/cm³). In gemology specific gravity is usually determined through an apparatus based on Archimedes' Principle.
