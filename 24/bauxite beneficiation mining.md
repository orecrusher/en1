Bauxite mining of both metallurgical and non-metallurgical grade ores is analogous to the mining of other industrial minerals. Normally the beneficiation or treatment of bauxite is limited to crushing sieving washing and drying of the crude ore

## Reasons For Bauxite Beneficiation 
Due to the high grade of reactive silica in the Brazilian bauxite ores the Brazilian mines have included a beneficiation plant to reduce the reactive silica prior to the refinery by removing the finer fraction of the material usually under 37 μm. Adopting the process of washing bauxite in the beneficiation plant can reduce caustic soda

## Beneficiation 
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.

A primary objective of the beneficiation process is to reduce the silica content in the ore as the latter reacts with caustic soda during the digestion step to precipitate out as insoluble sodium aluminium silies e.g. 2Na2O.2Al20;.3Si02.2 H20.
