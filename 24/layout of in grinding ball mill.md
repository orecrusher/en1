A ball mill is a drum-grinding unit where balls from solid materials (steel iron hard alloys ceramics etc) are used. Most common are ball mills where when the drum rotates and the balls rub against the inner walls the balls are lifted until the lifting angle becomes bigger than the angle of repose. Then the grinding media are again below.
