Because cyanide leaching is very efficient it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades. Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities

Ayacucho and Arequipa departments of Peru. In this area the processing of gold ores is made by traditional methods using amalgamation cyanidation or a combination of both methods. Usually miners do not determine the mineralogy and liberation characteristics of the ore before planning the processing procedure.

## gold cyanidation process in peru 
Gold cyanidationGold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.

Therefore an appropriate choice of the cyanidation process with relevant properties is significant to maximize the percent recovery with minimal operating cost (Kondos et al. 1995 Baral et al. 2014 Dowd and Onur 1993). Generally prior to cyanidation of gold ores cyanide amenability studies is performed on the ore to

## CYANIDE MANAGEMENT
In 2015 the gold mining industry experienced three significant events involving cyanide which we use to recover gold from its host ore. One of these events was at our Yanacocha operation in Peru where a worker was hospitalized after being exposed to cyanide when an outflow pipe from the cyanide storage tank was being unclogged. While the worker

## How Cyanide Leaching is Used in Gold Mining 
 · There have been several methods developed by miners to extract gold particles from ore over the last hundred or so years. Of those methods the 'Cyanide Leaching Process' (Cyanidation) is the method that is commonly used the most often to do this. As the name implies the main component in the process is a sodium []

## Cyanide Leaching 
Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years. During the cyanide leach process a cyanide solution or lixiviant is percolated through ore contained in vats columns or heaps. Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.
