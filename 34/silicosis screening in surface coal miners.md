## Dust Control In Mining Industry And Some Aspects Of Silicosis
 · In coal mining overexposure to respirable coal mine dust can lead to coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP). CWP is a lung disease that can be disabling and fatal in its most severe form. In addition miners can be exposed to high levels of respirable silica dust which can cause silicosis another disabling and/or fatal lung disease.
