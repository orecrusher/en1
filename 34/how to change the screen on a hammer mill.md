## Roller versus hammer: Corn particle size impacts 
 · Roller mills are the most common mill used in the U.S. Corn Belt. They are more energy efficient and generally result in a more uniform particle size than hammer mills. However hammer mills are still in use and preferred when the feed will be pelleted or a need for greater flexibility in particle size.

Hammer mill screens are available in a wide range of sizes to vary the consistency of your cut grains. To ensure a uniform mix a suction fan pulls the ground feed through the screen. Large mixing chamber holds 135 bushels of feed. That means fewer loads to mix and less time mixing for you – a definite plus for big livestock operations.

Munson's Pin Mill or "Centrifugal Impact Mill" reduces bulk materials into narrow particle size ranges without the need for screens hammers knives or rolls. Instead it relies on material impacting hundreds of pins thousands of times as it travels from the center to the periphery of the milling chamber.

## How Does a Hammer Mill Work? 
3. Hammer mills work in the principle that most materials will crush shatter or pulverize upon impact. 4. The Process: Material is fed into the mill grinding chamber through the feed chute typically by gravity. It repeatedly is struck by ganged hammers which are attached to a shaft which rotates at high speed inside the mill chamber.
