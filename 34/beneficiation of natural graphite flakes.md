## Graphite 
Graphite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ f ˌ aɪ t /) archaically referred to as plumbago is a crystalline form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure.It occurs naturally in this form and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions.Under high pressures and temperatures it converts to diamond.Graphite is used in pencils and lubricants.
