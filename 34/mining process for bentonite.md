## HOW TO SUCCEED IN A SMALL MINE
Twenty-one separate sales contracts were awarded between 1991 and 2000 for a total of 20000 tons of bentonite. Surface mining and processing at the rate of up to 100 tons per day with large equipment meant that the mine operated for an average of only about 20 days each year for the life of the operation.
