## Manganese 
Manganese is an essential element for modern industrial societies. Its principal use is in steelmaking where it serves as a purifying agent in iron-ore refining and as an alloy that converts iron into steel. Although the amount of manganese consumed to make a ton of steel is small ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms it is an irreplaceable component in the production of this fundamental material.
