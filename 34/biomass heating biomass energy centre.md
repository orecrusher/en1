Biomass is organic matter derived from living or recently living organisms. As an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Historically humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the time when people began burning wood to make fire.

## Is Biomass Right for your Business? 
Biomass systems need more fuel storage space than other heating systems. Biomass fuels have a lower energy density. This means a larger volume of fuel is required to supply an equal amount of energy. Your business should ensure that the correct fuel storage is used. This will depend on: Type of fuel used. Delivery of fuel. Loion of the boiler.
