## Metallurgy 
Metallurgy is defined as a process that is used for the extraction of metals in their pure form. The compounds of metals mixed with soil limestone sand and rocks are known as minerals. Metals are commercially extracted from minerals at low cost and minimum effort. These minerals are known as ores. A substance which is added to the charge in

## Metallurgy 
The field of extractive metallurgy encompasses many specialty sub-disciplines including mineral processing hydrometallurgy pyrometallurgy and electrometallurgy. Especially in hydrometallurgy the coordination chemistry of the metals involved plays a large role in their solubility and reactivity as the ore is refined into precious metal.
