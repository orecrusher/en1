## Cement manufacturing 
Cement is typically made from limestone and clay or shale. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry crushed to a very fine powder and then blended in the correct proportions. This blended raw material is called the 'raw feed' or 'kiln feed' and is heated in a rotary kiln where it reaches a temperature of about 1400 C to 1500 C.

## The cement kiln 
The milling process generates heat and excessive mill temperatures are undesirable. It is clearly helpful therefore if the clinker is cool as it enters the mill. From an environmental and a cost viewpoint the cooler reduces energy consumption by extracting heat from the clinker enabling it to be used to heat the raw materials.
