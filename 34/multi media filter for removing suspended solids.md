## Media Filters 
Anthracite filtration media is a great filtration material to remove and filter out turbidity and total suspended solids for the purposes of TSS water treatment. Since the specific gravity of anthracite is lighter than sand it is much used in combination with sand in dual-media filtration or with sand and garnet in multi media filters.

## Multimedia filtration 
Sand filtration is a frequently used very robust method to remove suspended solids from water. The filtration medium consists of a multiple layer of sand with a variety in size and specific gravity. Appliions for sand filtration: Preperation of cooling water. Treatment of waste water. Production of drinking water. Filtration in swimming pools.

## Water Handbook 
The most desirable media size depends on the suspended solids characteristics as well as the effluent quality requirements and the specific filter design. In general rapid sand filters use sand with an effective size of 0.35-0.60 mm (0.014-0.024 in.) and a maximum uniformity coefficient of 1.7.
