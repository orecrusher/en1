## Understanding Damping Techniques for Noise and Vibration 
vibration can be controlled using four methods: (1) absorption (2) use of barriers and enclosures (3) structural damping and (4) vibration isolation. Although there is a certain degree of overlap in these classes each method may yield a significant reduction in vibration and noise by proper analysis of the problem and appliion of the technique.
