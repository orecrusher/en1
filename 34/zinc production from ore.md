## Zinc: smelting producing and classifiion
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method. Secondary (recycled) zinc material such as zinc oxide is also processed with the zinc sulfide.

Compared to the great antiquity of these metals in a historical perspective regular production of zinc and brass and distillation of zinc is very late. Zinc is a difficult and enigmatic metal. In the earliest cementation process finely divided copper fragments were mixed with roasted zinc ore (oxide) and charcoal (a reducing agent) and heated to 1000°C in a sealed crucible.

The present proposal is for expansion of Lead – Zinc ore production from underground mine from 0.9 to 1.08 MMTPA (underground mine). The ore concentrate produced shall be processed by the existing HZL smelters for refining of Lead Zinc metal. The Rajpura Dariba deposit is loed in Relmagra Tehsil of District Rajsamand.

## Zinc Concentrate 
Sphalerite (zinc sulfide) is the primary ore mineral from which most of the world's zinc is produced but a number of other minerals that do not contain sulfide contain zinc as a major component. Much of the early zinc production was from nonsulfide deposits; however as these resources were exhausted production shifted to sulfide deposits.

## Recycling 
Zinc follows a complex life cycle from extraction as an ore through refinement and use in society to eventual collection and recycling of products at the end of life. This life cycle can be characterized by collecting information at various stages of production manufacturing use and waste management.

Zinc production from ore to metal involves different stages. The process of zinc mining removes the ore from the earth. However it is necessary to crush the ore and then separate the zinc from the other minerals. Zinc recovery from minerals can involve sintering and a pyrometallurgical process that requires a smelting furnace.
