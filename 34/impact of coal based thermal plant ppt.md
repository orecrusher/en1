## How are Thermal Power Plants Polluting the Environment?
Thermal pollution is the degradation of the local environment in particular the localized waterways that are changed by the discharge of waste water from the power plant. Impact on the Atmosphere. Thermal power plants are known to pump out a lot of greenhouse gases and ash which are by-products of burning the fossil fuels.

Coal based thermal power plants (CTPPs) need water in huge quantities and hence have a significant impact on water resources in the surroundings. However it is generally assumed that few such concerns exist with respect to coastal coal based power plants as they use sea water which is available in virtually unlimited amounts.

Coal: In a coal based thermal power plant coal is transported from coal mines to the generating station. Generally bituminous coal or brown coal is used as fuel. The coal is stored in either 'dead storage' or in 'live storage'. Dead storage is generally 40 days backup coal storage which is used when coal supply is unavailable.

## Power Generation from Coal 
Coal is the biggest single source of energy for electricity production and its share is growing. The efficiency of converting coal into electricity matters: more efficient power plants use less fuel and emit less climate-damaging carbon dioxide. This book explores how efficiency is measured and reported at coal-fired power plants.

## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? 
 · Thermal-based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal-fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants while producing power require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.
