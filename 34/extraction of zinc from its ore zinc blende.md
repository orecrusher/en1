 · Zinc is the 23rd most abundant element in the Earth's crust. The dominant ore is zinc blende also known as sphalerite. Other important zinc ores are wurzite smithsonite and hemimorphite. The main zinc mining areas are Canada Russia Australia USA and Peru'. Where we can found zinc? Whole grains and milk products are good sources of zinc.

## Extraction of Zinc 
The mixture is agitated by passing compressed air. Ore forms froth and comes to the surface while impurities are left in water. Zinc Blende does not contain a very high percentage of zinc and hence it needs to be concentrated. The best concentration method for zinc ore is known as froth flotation. Zn is extracted from Zinc blend mainly by 2 ways:

 · Electrolysis Zinc is extracted from the purified zinc sulfate solution by electrowinning which is a specialized form of electrolysis. Working: The process works by passing an electric current through the solution in a series of cells. This causes the zinc to deposits on the hodes (aluminum sheets) and oxygen to form at the anodes.
