## Milling Machine Operations 
The plain milling is the most common types of milling machine operations. Plain milling is performed to produce a plain flat horizontal surface parallel to the axis of rotation of a plain milling cutter. The operation is also known as slab milling. To perform the operation the work and the cutter are secured properly on the machine.
