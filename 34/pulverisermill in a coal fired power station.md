Inside the power station the coal is pulverised to a fine powder in giant grinding mills. This is because pulverised coal burns quickly like gas. The powdered coal is blown into the boiler furnace where it burns. Boilers as high as a 35-storey office block are the rectangular blocks that give power stations their distinctive look. They have
