## How silver is made 
Silver is rarely found alone but mostly in ores which also contain lead copper gold and other metals which may be commercially valuable. Silver emerges as a byproduct of processing these metals. To recover silver from zinc-bearing ores the Parkes process is used. In this method the ore is heated until it becomes molten.
