## The Working Principle of a Rotary Furnace
 · The Working Principle of a Rotary Furnace. A rotary furnace is a barrel-shaped instrument that is rotated around its axis when performing heat treatment. These instruments are tilted slightly to allow the sample under heat treatment to be passed from one end of the barrel to the other. This sample transfer occurs as the rotary furnace rotates

## Cement Kilns: Firing systems
"Firing" in cement industry parlance is the supply of heat to a kiln by use of a burning fuel. Throughout the early history of the industry fuel was added to static kilns in lump form pretty much in its "as-received" state. With the advent of the rotary kiln it was necessary to develop sophistied means of preparing the fuel and injecting it into the kiln

## Rotary Dryers 
Rotary dryers work by tumbling material in a rotating drum in the presence of a drying air. They can also be indirectly heated to avoid direct contact between the material and processing medium. The drum is positioned at a slight horizontal slope to allow gravity to assist in moving material through the drum.
