Concrete is a mixture of cement coarse aggregate fine aggregate and water. The cement hydrates with the water to form a binder. The result is a hardened mass with "filler" and pores. There are various types of cement for low heat rapid set and other properties. Other minerals or cementitious materials (like fly ash) may be added. E1
