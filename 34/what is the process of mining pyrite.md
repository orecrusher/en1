## Geotechnical Problems with Pyritic Rock and Soil
Oxidation of pyrite can significantly affect properties and the behavior of soil and rock in civil construction. Problems with pyritic rock and soil extend globally and across many disciplines. Consequences of pyrite oxidation include heave concrete degradation steel corrosion environmental damage acid mine drainage and accelerated weathering of rock with concomitant effects on strength

When miners reached a zone of pyrite in 1889 the mining slowed because it was not known how to extract gold from sulfides at the time. Subsequently John MacArthur Robert Forrest and William Forrest three Scotsmen working for the Tennant Company in Glasgow developed a dissolution process involving cyanide that would extract gold from sulfides.

## Pyrite: The Real Story Behind "Fool's Gold"
 · Pyrite was once a source of sulfur and sulfuric acid but today most sulfur is obtained as a byproduct of natural gas and crude oil processing. Today pyrite is sometimes sold as a novelty item or costume jewelry. But pyrite isn't entirely useless;

## Iron Ore Mining 
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

## Pyrite 
Pyrite has a pale brass yellow color with metallic luster greenish black streak and opaque characteristics. It is non-fluorescent and magnetic after heating. Its fractures are characterized by smooth curved surfaces. The average density of pyrite is 5.01 g/cm 3 and its hardness is 6.5.

 · The influence of commodity climate mine or process facility and mine phase on the nature of the mine drainage (ARD NMD or SD) can be illustrated using Ficklin diagrams or analogue versions. Ficklin diagrams are plots that can be used to interpret variations in mine drainage water chemistry between different deposits (Plumlee et al. 1999).

This is a piece of gold ore from the famous Witwatersrand gold deposits of South Africa. The ore consists of conglomerate pebbles mostly of quartz in a sandy matrix with abundant pyrite in the cement. The gold which occurs in the cement but not in the pebbles is closely connected with the pyrite and is not visible to the naked eye.

## 5.2 Chemical Weathering – Physical Geology
The runoff from areas where this process is taking place is known as acid rock drainage (ARD) and even a rock with 1% or 2% pyrite can produce significant ARD. Some of the worst examples of ARD are at metal mine sites especially where pyrite-bearing rock and waste material have been mined from deep underground and then piled up and left exposed to water and oxygen.

## An Introduction to Acid Mine Drainage
When pyrite is enclosed within rock only minimal amounts of pyrite are oxidized through natural weathering thereby generating only small amounts of acid. When fully exposed to air and water the chemical reactions forming AMD occur at a faster rate. This acid is sometimes naturally diluted or. neutralized by surrounding alkaline rocks.

The first step in the process involves a mild-regrind and mild acid leach of the tailings (pH 2.5 to 3.0) to dissolve up to 40% of the uranium. This uranium is recovered directly from the pulp by resin in pulp (RIP) with a strong base resin. The RIP tails are then treated by flotation to recover a rougher pyrite

Coal discard (with exposed pyrite due to processing the coal) and old workings (due to long time exposure) produce the highest concentration of AMD (Fuggle and Rabie 1992). Depending on the bulk composition an aCid-generating mine can become a 'perpetual pollution machine'. In the USA AMD from abandoned mines has
