## Kaolinite: The clay mineral kaolinite information and pictures
Kaolinite is a clay mineral with a soft consistency and earthy texture. It is easily broken and can be molded or shaped especially when wet. Kaolinite is a lackluster and uninteresting mineral on its own but it occasionally forms interesting pseudomorphs especially after feldspars. It is also a common accessory to other minerals including gem crystals in decomposing feldspar pegmatites.
