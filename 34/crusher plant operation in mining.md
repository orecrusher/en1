Crusher Blockage. Clearing blocked jaw crushers can be very hazardous and many plant operators have been killed carrying out this task. Blockage incidents can be greatly reduced by supplying rock that is properly sized to match the primary jaw opening. Prevention of oversize in feed material starts at the face with good fragmentation.
