## ore 
Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals. The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade like copper gold and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper an excellent conductor of electricity is used as electrical wire.Copper is also used in construction.

## Abstract 
MINE LIFE. Given a known ore reserve tonnage the life and daily capacity for a typical mining operation can be determined. Taylor developed an equation commonly used in prefeasibility studies to determine mine life known as Taylor's rule (equation 3). Based on this rule the basic equation for C (capacity of ore production in st/d) is:

## How to Become a Mining Engineer 
Mining engineers optimize mines for removing resources in the most efficient manner possible. They ensure that the as much of the resource as possible is extracted. Mining engineers often specialize in a particular mineral or metal such as iron or coal. Some collaborate with geologists to find and evaluate new ore deposits.

Mining The ore is removed from the ground in either open pit or underground mines. Underground – sinking a vertical shaft into the earth to reach the copper ore and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore. Open-pit – 90% of ore is mined using the open pit method. Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers. The ore
