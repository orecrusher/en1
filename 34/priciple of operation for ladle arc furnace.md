## US Patent for Method of operating ladle refining furnace 
The invention relates to a method of operating a ladle refining furnace for blowing Ar gas through bubbling lances submerged in molten steel in a ladle to stir the molten steel. The flow rate and the rate of change in the flow rate of the Ar gas blown through the bubbling lances are adjusted to prevent the iron lumps from attaching to the bubbling lances.
