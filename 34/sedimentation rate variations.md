 · A sedimentation rate is common blood test that is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body. The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the red blood cells (erythrocytes) sedimenting in a tube over a given period of time. Sedimentation rate is often abbreviated as "sed rate" or ESR.

 · Erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be identified as the rate at which red blood cells settle out when anticoagulated is allowed to stand. It is a non-specific indior of ongoing inflammation and tissue damage. It is affected by the concentrations of immunoglobulins and acute phase proteins like fibrinogen C-reactive protein and haptoglobin

## Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate..Westergren's Method
 · ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR): The Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a measure of settling of the red blood cells in an anti-coagulated whole blood sample which is allowed to stand in a narrow vertical tube during a specified period of time. Westergren's Method: Westergren's tube is used to measure ESR in this method: PROCEDURE:

 · No low: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is used to measure inflammation. An abnormally higher number denotes a higher amount of systemic inflammation. There technically are no "low" sedimentation rates as the normal ESR range starts at 0 mm/hour.

 · A high ESR or : Erythrocyte sedimentation rate means that there is significant inflammation in your body. It is not specific - so it does not tell us a diagnosis. The best solution - is to be assessed for cause and to address that. Take care.

Improved determination of marine sedimentation rates usingXSage' can determine variations in sedimentation rate between stratigraphic horizons of known age and thus produce high resolution age models. Using a Monte Carlo approach the program calculates uncertainties for these age models and on the durations of intervals between tie points.
