## Metallurgic Processes 
An ore is a type of rock that contains minerals with important elements such as metals. Ores are extracted through mining; they are then refined to extract the valuable element(s). The grade or concentration of an ore mineral or metal as well as its form of occurrence will directly affect the costs associated with mining it.

## How Gold Is Refined: A Step
The Refiner Separates the Gold and Lead Once everything has cooled down the refiner removes the lead button and places it in a porous cup known as a cupel. The refiner will then heat this in a cupellation furnace. When the cupel is heated the lead seeps out through the porous holes in the cupel leaving behind just the gold in a bead-like shape.

## Using Borax Flux to Refine Gold 
 · In metal refining a flux is sort of like a cleaning agent because it helps remove impurities from a sample. With some borax heat and a little know-how it's possible to extract pure gold from a sample of ore. This is because using borax as the flux reduces the melting point of all the elements in a piece of ore including gold.
