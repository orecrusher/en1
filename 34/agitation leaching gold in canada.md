A cyanide leaching circuit usually consists of large agitated tanks for mixing mineral slurry with cyanide in order to extract gold. Typically the slurry consists of 30-40% solids by weight with the solid particles being less than 100 microns (0.1mm) in size. Air or oxygen is often bubbled through the slurry to improve the leaching reaction.

A cyanide leaching circuit usually consists of large agitated tanks for mixing mineral slurry with cyanide in order to extract gold. Typically the slurry consists of 30-40% solids by weight with the solid particles being less than 100 microns (0.1mm) in size. Air or oxygen is often bubbled through the slurry to improve the leaching reaction.
