## Working Principle of Voltmeter and Types of Voltmeter 
 · Working Principle of Voltmeter. The main principle of voltmeter is that it must be connected in parallel in which we want to measure the voltage. Parallel connection is used because a voltmeter is constructed in such a way that it has a very high value of resistance. So if that high resistance is connected in series than the current flow will
