The invention relates to a method and an installation for coal grinding in inert operation or in non-inert operation wherein a proportion of the coal dust produced in a mill is fed to a classifier for separation of super fines. The super fines are fed to a hot gas generator with solid fuel burner in order to heat the re-circulated process gas and to feed it back to the mill.
