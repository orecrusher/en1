## Mining Beneficiation Plants 
Ore beneficiation plants consist of "ore preparation" and "ore beneficiation" steps. Most of the mineral preparation part is the main crusher part of the plant. With the desired grain size reduction from the crusher part the correct enrichment method is applied according to the mineralogy of the ore.
