## Environmental Cost of Refineries
Although mining exposes all of the contaminants refining isolates and concentrates waste in order to isolate and concentrate the desired final product. Refining processes also often use harsh acids and bases to separate the desired metals from the wastes which can harm the environment by themselves when they change soil and water chemistry.
