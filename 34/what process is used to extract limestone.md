## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron 
 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.

Lead is extracted from its ore by reduction with carbon. The process used is froth flotation although single-stage methods with lower energy use and emissions are also used. After mixing with limestone the filtered concentrated ore is roasted in air or oxygen-enriched air on a moving belt.
