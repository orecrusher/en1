## Material Removal Mechanism of Chemo
An innovative fixed abrasive grinding process of chemo-mechanical grinding (CMG) by using soft abrasive grinding wheel (SAGW) has been recently proposed to achieve a damage-free ground workpiece surface. The basic principle ideas and characteristics of CMG with SAGW are briefly introduced in this paper. The CMG experiments using newly developed SAGW for Si wafer are
