## History of cement 
Use of ball mills to grind clinker and raw materials From the turn of the 20th century rotary cement kilns gradually replaced the original vertical shaft kilns used originally for making lime. Rotary kilns heat the clinker mainly by radiative heat transfer and this is more efficient at higher temperatures enabling higher burning temperatures to be achieved.
