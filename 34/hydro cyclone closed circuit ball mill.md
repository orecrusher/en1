Often when we're investigating a mill circuit there are cases where the amount of new feed to the plant has exceeded the ability of the mill to grind the ore fine enough to allow the cyclones to generate the desired

## what is hydrocyclone 
 · They are most commonly employed in closed circuit within grinding circuits and are used to return coarse material back to the ball or rod mill for further grinding. The main advantages of cyclones are that they have large capacities relative to their size and can separate at finer sizes than most other screening and classifiion equipment.
