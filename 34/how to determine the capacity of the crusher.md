## How To Calculate Cubic Feet
 · There are only three measurements you need to take to work out the volume or capacity in cubic feet: length width and height. It's worth being aware of the object you're measuring however. For example if you're aiming to measure the cubic feet capacity of a refrigerator you need to measure the space inside the fridge and not the dimensions of the exterior.
