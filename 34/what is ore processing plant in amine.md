An amine system (olamine system) removes hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from various fuel gases produced in a refinery so as to prevent air pollution when the gases are burned. Amine plants consist basically of two units (Figure 2.1): (1) the absorber in which the unwanted constituents are removed and (2) the regenerator in which the solvent solution is reactivated.

 · Acid Gas Loading in Amine Solutions. A typical amine sweetening process includes an absorber unit and a regenerator unit. In the absorber the amine solution absorbs H2S and CO2 from the sour gas to produce a sweetened gas stream as a product and a rich amine solution with the absorbed acid gases. This rich amine is then routed into the

## Sour gas sweetening 
 · Corrosion is common in most amine plants. It is necessary to control the corrosion rate by the addition of corrosion inhibitor and by use of stainless steel in certain pieces of process equipment. In the case of MEA solutions corrosion rates tend to increase with increasing solution strengths beyond about 22% MEA as well as with high levels of amine degradation products in the solution.
