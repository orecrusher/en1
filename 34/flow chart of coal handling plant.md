Coal: In a coal based thermal power plant coal is transported from coal mines to the generating station. Generally bituminous coal or brown coal is used as fuel. The coal is stored in either 'dead storage' or in 'live storage'. Dead storage is generally 40 days backup coal storage which is used when coal supply is unavailable.

To summarize the coal mill controls they may be divided basically into two major egories:. 1. To control the quality of coal being sent to the burners loed on the furnace walls. The word quality here means the temperature and fineness of the PF. The set temperature values are dependent on the percentage of volatile matter that exists in the main fuel.
