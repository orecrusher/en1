## Cylinder Head Fundamentals: Materials Options and Terms 
This refers to a machining process applied to a standard cast head using a computer numerical control (CNC) machine. Casting a cylinder head involves pouring molten metal into either a sand-cast mold or permanent mold to form the head. This process while efficient is not entirely precise.

## What is a Cylinder Head? (with picture)
Cylinder heads are an important part of a combustion engine. Internal combustion engines typically include a cylinder block which houses the pistons and the cylinders through which they move and a cylinder head to cap off the block. Certain engine configurations have multiple cylinder heads each of which sits upon its own bank of cylinders.
