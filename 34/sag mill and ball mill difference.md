The SAG mill trommel undersize is combined with the ball mills' discharge and pumped to two parallel packs (clusters) of twelve 660 mm diameter cyclones. The cyclone underflow from each line reports to a ball mill while the cyclone overflow is directed to the flotation circuit. The designed ball milling circuit product is 80% passing 150 µm.

## What is the difference between a SAG mill and ball mill?
SAG is an acronym for semi-autogenous grinding. SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill. A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder. SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%. The largest SAG mill is 42′ (12.8m) in diameter powered by a 28 MW (38000 HP) motor.

## Ball mill 
A ball mill a type of grinder is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores chemicals ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media including ceramic balls flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.

## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill 
 · Ball mill is a fine grinder. A horizontal or vertical rotating cylinder which is filled partially with the balls of ceramics small rocks and balls made from stainless steel. The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 29% to 30%. By friction and influence of tumbling balls inside rotating cylinder grinds the raw material to the required fineness.
