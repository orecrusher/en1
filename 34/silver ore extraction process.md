## processing silver ores 
 · Once silver ore has been removed from a mine it is crushed into a fine powder. Silver is commonly extracted from the powdered ore by smelting or chemical leaching. Silver's melting point occurs at 962 C (1764 F 1235.15K). As such industrial metallurgic processes are needed to prepare silver for commercial purposes.

## Geology of Silver 
 · Since silver is found mostly as a compound its primary method of production is as a secondary by-product of electrolytic refinement. The method utilized is called the Parkes process where the silver is removed from lead and some other types of metal through a liquid-to-liquid extraction procedure.

## Smelting and Roasting Ores to recover gold silver and 
The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

## Hard Rock Mining Gold and Silver Ore and processing it
In most gold ores the final process to extract the tiniest gold particles is the use of cyanide to dissolve the gold. Cyanide in the presence of oxygen actually dissolves both gold and silver. It is both efficient and inexpensive so it is widely used in precious metal ore processing.

## How is Silver Mined 
While many technologies exist Silver is typically mined through a process that uses gravity to break and extract ore from large deposits. The exact method of ore removal used varies by the physical characteristics of the rock surrounding the metal as well as the unique shape of the deposit.

The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. The process which uses mercury amalgamation to recover silver from ore was reportedly invented by Bartolomé de Medina in Pachuca Mexico in 1554. It replaced smelting as the primary method of extracting silver from ore at Spanish colonies in the Americas.

## Melting Silver 
 · Silver is the main metal in e-waste recycling. If you have silver in metal form then you can easily melt this. But if you have silver in powder form like silver chloride then you can face many problems in melting silver. As usually silver melts at 961 C and this temperature point is less than gold melting but melting silver is hard and technical.

 · It involved mixing silver ore with salt and other mineral compounds then using tethered mules to churn the mixture. It was followed by the "von Patera process" which used heat to remove silver chloride from ore. Silver mining was brought to North America in the eighteenth century where several additional methods of mining were developed.

The silver being heavier settles at the bottom. Finally the workers skim off the waste floating on top. In less than 5 minutes the molten silver cool and hardens enabling workers to extract what is now a silver bar. Then the mining company sells the bar to a refinery for processing into industrial grade silver.
