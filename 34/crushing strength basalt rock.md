## Basalt Rock 
The rock hardness of basalt is 6 as per the Mohs scale and can be observed through a combination of its compressive strength. Generally Mpa or Megapascal is the compressive strength. Its tensile strength is10-30 Mpa and its shear strength is 20-60 Mpa which denotes that depending on the mineral makeup basalt rocks fall in the egory of a strong – very strong.
