## How Solar Panels Are Made 
Silica is mined from the earth and is found in sand rock and quartz. Because silica has a dioxide component it must be taken to a plant where it is converted to silicon through a heating process. According to the United States Geological Society there are six domestic companies that produce silicon materials at eight plants.

Silica. Also called silica sand or quartz sand silica is silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful easy to mine and relatively easy to process it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock quartzite is another source.
