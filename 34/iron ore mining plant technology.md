In nature iron occurs as ore. In mining the ore is extracted from the rock and processed. To make iron from the ore it is reduced and melted in a blast furnace with coke at over 1300°C. The resulting pig iron contains more than 2% carbon and cannot be used for products in this form.

## Iron ore 
Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron which is one of the main raw materials to make steel—98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel. In 2011 the Financial Times quoted Christopher LaFemina mining analyst at Barclays Capital saying that iron ore is "more integral to the global economy than any other commodity except perhaps oil ".

 · Iron ore producing companies supply a vital component of modern industry with iron ore used across the world primarily as an ingredient in steel manufacturing. The metallic ores which can vary in colour from dark grey and bright yellow to purples and reds comprise around 5% of the Earth's crust and are commonly found in four main types of deposit the most frequently mined being hematite.
