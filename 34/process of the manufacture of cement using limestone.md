The Cement Manufacturing Process Advancing Mining. Aug 20 2015 Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay to a fine powder called raw meal which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 Â°C in a cement kiln.

## The Manufacture of Portland Cement 
Portland cement (the only type of cement in common use today) is manufactured in a four step process. Step 1 - Quarrying Limestone and a 'cement rock' such as clay or shale are quarried and brought to the cement works. These rocks contain lime (CaCO3) silica (SiO2) alumina (Al2O3) and ferrous oxide (Fe2O3) - the raw materials of cement

Portland cement the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete mortar stucco and non-speciality grout was developed in England in the mid 19th century and usually originates from limestone. James Frost produced what he called "British cement" in a similar manner around the same time but did not obtain a patent until 1822.
