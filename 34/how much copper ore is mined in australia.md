Copper ore is mined in the X41 and Enterprise underground mines where it is roughly crushed then hoisted to the surface for processing. From here it is fed through a series of ball mills that grind the rock into a fine dust. This dust is then mixed with water and reagents in the concentrator's flotation circuit.
