## How steel is made 
To make steel iron ore is first mined from the ground. It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added. In fact a very simple definition of steel is "iron alloyed with carbon usually less than 1%." Blast furnaces require many auxiliary facilities to support their operations.
