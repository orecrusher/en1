Crushed ore is ball or rod-milled in large rotating cylindrical machines until it becomes a powder usually containing less than 1 percent copper. Sulfide ores are moved to a concentrating stage while oxide ores are routed to leaching tanks. 3. Concentrating Minerals are concentrated into a slurry that is about 15% copper. Waste slag is removed.
