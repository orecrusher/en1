## Installation Operation Maintenance Manual
A DAF (Dissolved Air Flotation) system creates microscopic air bubbles that are attached to incoming wastewater particles in order to float them. Once floated they are separated from the wastewater and skimmed from the top and into the float scum chamber. The treated wastewater then exits from near the bottom of the DAF.

The saturation unit is supplied by a water flow and an air flow. The water flow is about 6% - 8% of the total water flow through the treatment plant and is abstracted downstream of the flotation process. The water is pumped into a pressure vessel at a pressure of 4 to 8 bar. Air is supplied to the pressure vessel via an air compressor.
