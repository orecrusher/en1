## Silver explained 
 · The open pit method involves using heavy machinery to mine deposits relatively near the earth's surface. In underground mining deep shafts are dug into the ground to extract ore. Once ores are extracted they are crushed ground and separated through a process called "flotation" to achieve mineral concentrations that are 30-40 times higher than naturally occurs.

 · But mining still starts with extracting mineral resources from the earth. Here we'll examine traditional and novel mining techniques. The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.

The three most frequent surface mining methods are generally strip mining terrace exploration and open pit exploration. Strip mining is if at all possible applied where the surface of the terrain and the ore body itself are generally relatively horizontal and not way too deep under the surface and a wide area is available to be mined in a series of whitening strips.
