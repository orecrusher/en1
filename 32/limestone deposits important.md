## limestone 
Limestone has two origins: (1) biogenic precipitation from seawater the primary agents being lime-secreting organisms and foraminifera; and (2) mechanical transport and deposition of preexisting limestones forming clastic deposits. Travertine tufa caliche chalk sparite and micrite are all varieties of limestone. Limestone has long fascinated earth scientists because of its rich fossil

## Why are depositional environments important?
Limestone rock made of the calcium carbonate mineral known as calcite can form in a variety of depositional environments from hot spring deposits in lakes to coral reefs in the tropical oceans. Most limestone originates in shallow waters of tropical oceans and may carry fossils of plants and animals that lived in those marine environments.

## What Are the Characteristics of Limestone?
 · What Are the Characteristics of Limestone? Limestone is a common type of sedimentary rock with a high calcium carbonate composition. Due to its calcium content limestone is a soft rock that erodes easily. Like other sedimentary rocks limestone forms from layers of other material that undergoes compression over time.
