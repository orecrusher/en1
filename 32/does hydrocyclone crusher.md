 · Hydrocyclone is an effective fine particle classifing equipment in the present mineral processing equipment. Its structure is relatively simple with a cylinder on the top and a conical container on the bottom. The slurry is fed into the hydrocyclone at a certain speed along the tangential direction which generates a large centrifugal force due to the rotary motion.

## Hydrocyclone Feed Pump Pressure PSI vs Operating Parameters
 · For a hydrocyclone to work at peak efficiency the volume of slurry and the feed pump delivery pressure must remain constant. If the cyclone feed pump is allowed to SURGE the up and down pressure will cause poor separation at the point of high and low operating pressure. There is a cycle to a surging pump box that causes this pressure fluctuation.

HYDROCYCLONES. The hydrocyclone is a simple piece of equipment that uses fluid pressure to generate centrifugal force and a flow pattern which can separate particles or droplets from a liquid medium. These particles or droplets must have a sufficiently different density relative to the medium in order to achieve separation.
