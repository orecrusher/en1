Coal found in sedimentary rock is crushed into the appropriate size and used as fuel for electricity generation or the iron-making process. Lumps of coal can be used directly as a fuel. However some coal is first washed to make it into 'high grade coal'. It can also be sorted into various sizes depending on what the fuel is required for.

## What are the different types of coal? 
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat which is made of partly decayed plant materials deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat which transforms it into coal a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types or "ranks" of coal are determined by carbon content.
