CLS will leach pieces of gold 40 mesh and smaller within 8 to 12 hours. This is a definite advantage over cyanide which can take up to a week to leach 40 mesh gold. This presents a number of trade-offs between CLS and cyanide. In most cases the CLS leaching system can be built much smaller than the cyanide system.
