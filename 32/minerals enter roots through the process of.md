Root Interception: Root interception is the process in which roots grow through the soil profile to come in contact with nutrients. This process is dependent on the roots to do the work and grow throughout the soil to seek out nutrients. As the root grows through the soil it generally only comes in contact with about 1% of soil volume.

How do plants absorb water and minerals from the soil. · Roots play only a passive role of serving as channel for water movement. Absorption of Minerals. Mineral salts are absorbed by the root through the process of diffusion. Inorganic salts are absorbed in the form of ions. Each type of ion is taken up according to its requirement.

Water is found in the spaces between the soil particles. Water and mineral salts first enter through the cell wall and cell membrane of the root hair cell by osmosis. Root hair cells are outgrowths at the tips of plants' roots (Figure 5.27). They function solely to take up water and mineral salts.
