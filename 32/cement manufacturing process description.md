View the interactive animation of the cement production process to learn how cement is made by CEMEX. 1. Mining the raw material. Limestone and clay are blasted from rock quarries by boring the rock and setting off explosives with a negligible impact of the environment due to the modern technology employed. 2. Transporting the raw material.

Manufacturing - the cement kiln. Most Portland cement is made in a rotary kiln. Basically this is a long cylinder rotating about its axis once every minute or two. The axis is inclined at a slight angle the end with the burner being lower. The rotation causes the raw meal to gradually pass along from where it enters at the cool end to the

## Digital solutions for the cement industry 
The cement manufacturing process is a highly energy-intensive process with many unpredictable disturbances. To manage process the operators are spending a lot of time efforts and have to permanently monitor the process very carefully. The goal of the Kiln Control System (KCS) is to increase the quality as well as efficiency of clinker

## 1. Descriptions of manufacturing processes
Descriptions of manufacturing processes Due to the adoption of energy conservation measures it was necessary to make a-detailed analysis of the process involved and equipment used in such a process. This analysis had to identify the amount type and quality of energy required so as to identify possible energy savings compatible to the respective cost-benefit analysis.

 · We first discuss cement production and special nomenclature used by cement industrialists in expressing the composition of their cement products. We reveal different types of cement products their compositions properties and typical uses. Wherever possible we tend to give reasons as to why a particular cement type is more suitable for a given purpose than other types.
