When compacted the aggregates are pushed closer together which reduces the amount of air in the mix and increases the concrete's density. RCC is dry enough to be compacted by vibratory rollers but moist enough spread evenly. It can therefore be used as a pavement and also as a concrete product for building dams parking lots platforms etc.

The concrete mix achieves a high density and cures over time into a strong monolithic block. Roller-compacted concrete is typically used for concrete pavement but has also been used to build concrete dams as the low cement content causes less heat to be generated while curing than typical for conventionally placed massive concrete pours.
