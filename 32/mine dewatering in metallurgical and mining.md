 · Mine dewatering boasts two primary purposes or objectives that mining sites can fully utilise. One of its purposes is to effectively control and lower the inflow of groundwater levels. This specific purpose is said to be the general mine dewatering which usually involves the interception and collection of both ground and surface water before pumping them away from the site.

## Pressure to decarbonize: Drivers of mine
 · Metallurgical coal's carbon footprint will become increasingly relevant to a decarbonizing steel industry. Evident in the distribution of open-pit and underground mines excavation type and to a lesser extent mine depth and fugitive methane drives variations in emissions intensity for metallurgical coal operations (Exhibit 2).

## Water and energy assessment for dewatering in opencast mines
 · A dewatering system of an opencast mine has parallel pumps to remove mine water for accessibility of production. The mine water increases with the increase in pit area and depth. The objective of this work is to predict the water removal rate and energy requirement for water pumping in opencast mines and analyse the variations with the depth as mining progresses.

 · Why mine dewatering? The groundwater level must be pulled down to create dry conditions in the mining area so that the generally low strength aquifer sequence materials (sands gravel and clays) can be safely excavated. Mine dewatering is usually undertaken for a variety of geo-technical (material strength considerations) mining and safety
