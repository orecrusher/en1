## Wet vs Dry Grinding 
 · Hope I'm posting in the correct area. I would like to know what the advantages of wet grinding compared to dry grinding are (if any). Would one expect wet ground material to exhibit different leaching characteristics from dry ground materials even when particle size distributions are identical? I'm dealing with uranium ores in a lab scale ball mill (Bond Ball Mill).

 · Wet grinding often takes place in ball pebble or rod mills. The efficiency of wet grinding can be higher than that for dry grinding but wear of equipment is also higher [2]. Most size-reduction equipment is subject to heavy wear and therefore parts such as casing liners hammers and jaws are designed for relatively easy replacement.

 · Ball mills are a special instrument used to break up hard solids into a fine powder. They are similar to rock tumblers in that the instrument is a rotating container filled with heavy balls to grind the substance into powder. Ceramic material crystalline compounds and even some metals can be ground up using a ball mill.

Sag mills in the gold and copper operations would vary from 6%- 15% and are normally grate discharge types in most cases the densities of the slurry in the mill is over 65% and that goes for ball mills also. Off course you have a upper limit or the balls will "float" out. Higher densities allow better grind and increase residence time in the mill.
