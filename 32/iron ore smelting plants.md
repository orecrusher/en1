## Smelting 
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract out a base metal.It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores including silver iron copper and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

 · For iron once the ore is obtained through open cast or underground mining it's conveyed up to the surface for crushing washing and then taken to the smelter. At the smelter the crushed ore is put into a blast furnace along with limestone and coke and subjected to hot air blasting and heat and it turns to molten iron.
