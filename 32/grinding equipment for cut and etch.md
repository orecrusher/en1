## Metallographic Abrasive Grinding
Note for SiC grinding papers as the abrasive grains dull and cut rates decrease increasing grinding pressures can extend the life of the SiC paper. Higher grinding/polishing pressures can also generate additional frictional heat which may actually be beneficial for the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of ceramics minerals and composites.
