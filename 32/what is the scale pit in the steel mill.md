## Pitting Corrosion 
Pitting factor: ratio of the depth of the deepest pit resulting from corrosion divided by the average penetration as calculated from weight loss.  Pitting resistance equivalent number (PREN): an empirical relationship to predict the pitting resistance of austenitic and duplex stainless steels. It is expressed as PREN = Cr + 3.3 (Mo + 0.5 W) + 16N.

## Step 7 – Corrosion Guide 
During the steel making process natural low energy iron ore is refined into metal. This process adds a great deal of energy to the metal. Once the steel is placed into a corrosive environment it will by natural means return to its low energy state over time. To make the return trip the steel must give up the energy gained at the mill.

## Scale formation and its removal in Hot Rolling process
During hot rolling of steel its surface is exposed to air which leads to oxidation resulting in scale formation. The scale formation is affected by the temperature steel grade surrounding atmosphere and the exposure time. There are two kinds of scales relevant in rolling mills – sticky and dry scales.
