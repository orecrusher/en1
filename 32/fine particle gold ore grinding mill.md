## Gold grinding process and equipment 
 · Gold grinding process Grinding also known as milling pulverising or comminution is the process of reducing gold materials to powder or very fine particle size. Gold grinding process is different from crushing or granulation process reducing the raw material to a rock pebble or grain size.gold grinding is an integral part of gold mining process.

## [PDF] Ultra Fine Grinding
Since early 2001 Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines (KCGM) has successfully operated an ultra fine grinding (UFG) circuit to supplement its roaster capacity for the treatment of the refractory gold flotation concentrate. A second UFG mill was installed in 2002 taking the total UFG capacity to over 20tph while grinding to 11-12 microns and achieving over 90% gold recovery.

## Gold and Silver Leaching by Cyanidation
 · Grinding is usually performed in a ball mill for the purpose of reducing the ore to sufficient fineness that the gold particles may be exposed to the dissolving action of the cyanide solution. This dissolving action may begin either in the ball mill or in the agitators.

## Energy Use of Fine Grinding in Mineral Processing 
 · Fine grinding to P80 sizes as low as 7 μm is becoming increasingly important as mines treat ores with smaller liberation sizes.This grinding is typically done using stirred mills such as the Isamill or Stirred Media Detritor. While fine grinding consumes less energy than primary grinding it can still account for a substantial part of a mill's energy budget.
