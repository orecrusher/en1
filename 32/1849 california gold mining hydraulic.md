 · Hydraulic Mining in California. By Craig E. Crouch Rocklin CaliforniaHydraulic mining uses jets of water to break down gold-laden gravel banks and to wash the material through gold-separating devices (sluices and under-currents). It was one of the dominant forms of the California gold mining industry from the mid-1850s until 1884 when it was halted by federal injunction.

The gold mines that were the focus of these forty-eighters and forty-niners fell into three major regions. The first discoveries were along the American River and other tributaries to the Sacramento River. Not long thereafter gold was found in the tributaries to the San Joaquin which flowed north to join the Sacramento in the great delta east of San Francisco Bay.

## Hydraulic Mining. Historic Gold Mining Methods of California
Hydraulic Mining was a gold recovery method that was used during many of the gold rushes around the world during the 1800's. It was used extensively in California's Mother Lode county during the famous gold rush there. One of the problems that the early California gold miners faced with basic placer mining was the amount of manual labor that was required to process the gravels.

In 1891 a group of government engineers estimated that hydraulic mining had deposited cubic yards of debris along the basins of three rivers alone -- the Yuba American and Bear. The environmental results were astrophic. A typical description was penned in 1868 by Samuel Bowles a visitor to the California gold country:
