## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? 
 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## Iron Processing 
Our heavy-duty iron ore balling drums are relied on by some of the industry's top producers to process iron ore fines into pellets for the steelmaking process. The use of a disc pelletizer is a popular alternative approach to pelletizing iron ore fines as this offers more control over pellet size and produces a more refined pellet product.

Iron ores always contain some additional gangue. The type and amount depend on the iron ore itself and the beneficiation process. Typical remaining oxides are SiO 2 CaO MgO and Al 2 O 3. Wang and Sohn 43 investigated the effect of CaO and SiO 2 on swelling and iron whisker formation during the reduction of iron oxide compacts.

## An Overview of Steelmaking Process Global Market Size 
The first metallurgical step involved in this process is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron in a blast furnace using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent. The produced metallic iron contains a relatively high proportion of carbon (4%) and it is passed to the steelmaking process in the form of liquid at approximately 1450 C called as 'hot metal'.

Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel. 98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel. Uncontaminated iron ore is almost nameless on the exterior of the Earth apart from the combination of Fe-Ni alloys from meteorites and very atypical forms of unfathomable mantle xenoliths.
