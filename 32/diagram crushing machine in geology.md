## Crushers 
Impact crushers are versatile crushing machines that can be used in any stage of the crushing process. However the features and capabilities of different impact crusher types vary considerably. Impact crushers are traditionally classified to two main types: horizontal shaft impact (HSI) crushers and vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers.
