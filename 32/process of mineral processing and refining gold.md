 · Gold usually exists in nature in combination with other rocks and minerals. Some of these such as silver and copper may also be precious or semi-precious but a variety of base metals are usually also present. Though several different techniques exist any process used to separate metal from impurities or unwanted material is called refining.

## The Gold Smelting Process 
 · Refining GoldSmelting is not always the final stage in gold extraction. Depending on the intended use of the gold it may have to be refined before being put to use. Refining gold is simply the process of removing the finer impurities that the smelting process could not remove. There are several methods used to refine gold.
