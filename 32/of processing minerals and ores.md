## 12.3: Metals and Ores 
Metal ores contain sufficient minerals with important elements including metals that can be economically extracted from the rock. The ores must be processed to extract the metals of interest from the waste rock and from the ore minerals. Alloys are mixtures of materials at least one of which is a metal. Bronze alloys were widely used in weapons.

## Lead and Zinc 
6.1.2.2 Lead and Zinc Ore Concentration If the mineral veins separate from the rock cleanly then processing workers can concentrate the ore by taking advantage of the greater weight mineral compared to the rock. Jigging separates coarse lumps. In this process the crushed ore is agitated or shaken in water with a vertical motion.

## Introduction to Mineral Processing 
In mineral processing a number of unit operations are required to prepare and classify ores before the valuable constituents can be separated or concentrated and then forwarded on for use or further treatment. The field of mineral processing has also been given other titles such as mineral dressing ore dressing mineral extraction mineral beneficiation and mineral engineering. These terms are

## Ore 
Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals typically containing metals that can be mined treated and sold at a profit. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains.

Processes of Ore Formation. Current theories of the genesis of ore deposit can be divided into internal (endogene) and external (exogene) or surface processes. It must be understood that more than one mechanism may be responsible for the formation of an ore body.
