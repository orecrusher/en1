## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? 
 · Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This is not very soluble so rocks don't dissolve very quickly. But if you add an acid you add hydrogen ions (H+) which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3- ions which are very soluble in water and the limestone will dissolve. Or if there is more acid two hydrogen ions will
