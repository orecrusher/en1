## Global Electricity Review 2020 
Global coal-fired electricity generation fell by 3% in 2019 leading to a 2% fall in CO2 power sector emissions. Both of these are the biggest falls since at least 1990. Coal collapsed in the EU and the US; but Chinese coal generation rose and for the first time was responsible for half of global coal generation.

## Electricity and power generation 
Some methods of generating electricity like burning gas and coal create greenhouse gases that cause climate change. People are trying to make more of our electricity in ways that are good for the environment like using wind power or solar power. Wind power generates electricity by using the wind to turn the big arms on a wind turbine.

## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? 
 · Thermal-based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal-fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants while producing power require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.

Nuclear fuels are not burnt to release energy they are involved in nuclear reactions where atoms are split to release large amounts of energy as heat. The rest of the process of generating electricity is then the same as in coal oil and gas the heat energy is used to boil water which generates steam.
