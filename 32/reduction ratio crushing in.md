Cone Crushers Mclanahan. A general rule of thumb for applying cone crushers is the reduction ratio. a crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. thus with a 3⁄4" closed side setting the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing.

Crusher Reduction Ratio I have mentioned the fact that as the % of voids in the crushing chamber decreases the production of fines by attrition increases. This is like saying that as the Crusher Reduction Ratio in any given crusher is increased the % of fines in the product will increase even though the discharge setting remains unchanged.
