## Coal Power for Kids – Electric Choice
Electric Power The majority of coal is used to generate electricity. This electricity helps to light your home and power your appliances! Power plants burn coal to create steam. That steam then moves special turbines to generate power. Heat There are many businesses that use coal to run their processes and factories.

## Energy 
Energy flow diagrams. Energy flow diagrams can illustrate how energy is transformed from one form of energy to other forms of energy. There is often branching where one form of energy can be transformed into two or more other forms at the same time. The diagram shows a mobile phone in use. Sketch energy flow diagrams for the following:

## How a Coal Plant Works 
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced under tremendous pressure flows into a turbine which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.
