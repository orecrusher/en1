Filtration. Filtration is a separation method used to separate out pure substances in mixtures comprised of particles some of which are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material.Particle size can vary considerably given the type of mixture. For instance stream water is a mixture that contains naturally occurring biological organisms like bacteria viruses and protozoans.
