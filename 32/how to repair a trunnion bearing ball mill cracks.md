## Re: Trunnion lubriionor all you ever wanted to know 
At this time I replaced the trunnions not because they were worn out but because I was replacing everything at once. The old ones about 21 years old were in good condition. Now with 270000+ miles everything is still going fine. I think most of the trunnion problems stem from lack of driving together with lack of any luberiion.

## Understanding Journal Bearings 
Bearings are used to prevent friction between parts during relative movement. In machinery they fall into two primary egories: anti-friction or rolling element bearings and hydrodynamic journal bearings. The primary function of a bearing is to carry load between a rotor and the case with as little wear as possible.
