## Zinc Ore 
Gold recovery from copper-zinc ores is usually higher than that obtained from either a lead-zinc or copper lead-zinc ore.This is attributed to two main factors: when selecting a reagent scheme for treatment of Cu-Zn ores there are more choices than for the other ore types which can lead to the selection of a reagent scheme more favourable for gold flotation.
