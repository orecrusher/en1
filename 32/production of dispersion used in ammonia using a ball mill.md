## How Does an Ammonia Refrigeration System Work? 
Ammonia refrigeration systems operate in a similar manner to fluorocarbon systems but have several key differences. While you will not usually find an ammonia-based system inside a home (ammonia is a very toxic substance and the refrigerators are very expensive) they are used in factories that need large refrigeration devices that can cool substances very quickly.
