## Difference Between a Lathe a Milling Machine 
 · Difference Between a Lathe a Milling Machine. Lathes and milling machines are both used for cutting raw material but they have very different ways of doing so. Lathes spin the material whereas a milling machine uses a spinning tool for various cutting operations. To utilize either you must know the differences between the two and what each

## Rawmill 
 · A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into " rawmix " during the manufacture of cement. Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln which transforms it into clinker which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.

After milling pavement surfaces should be cleaned off (see Figure 2) before any overlay is placed otherwise dirt and dust may decrease bonding between the new overlay and the existing pavement. Milling also produces a rough grooved surface which will increase the existing pavement's surface area when compared to an ungrooved surface.
