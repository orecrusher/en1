## Iron Ore 
Iron ores - Sampling of slurries ISO 16742:2014 sets out the basic methods for sampling fine iron ore of nominal top size 1 mm that is mixed with water to form a slurry. At very high ratios of fine solids to water when the material assumes a soft plastic form (about 80 % solids depending on the particle size distribution of the solids) the mixture is correctly termed a paste.
