## Know the Basics of Dispersing Nanosize Materials 
Date recorded: May 28 2019. Duration: 56 minutes 12 seconds. 'Nano' is all about small. A dispersed system is smaller than its agglomerated or aggregated precursor. The fundamental physical principles outlining dispersion in small systems will be discussed. This should act as a primer to those interested in making stable systems < 100 nm.

## Milling 
Ball mills can be designed to operate continuously (fed at one end of the system and discharged at the other) or on a batch basis for smaller or intermittent volumes. They can also be operated either on a stand-alone basis ('open-circuit grinding') or in conjunction with a classifier which returns oversize product to the mill for further grinding ('closed-circuit grinding').

 · Type A: Media ball near the wall and passing underneath the load in the mill: Consider a media ball being pressed against the wall in a mill as it passes underneath the tumbling load. Assume that the volume of slurry in the mill is less than the voids between the media so that the slurry is not providing hydrostatic support to the media i.e. they are not suspended in the slurry.
