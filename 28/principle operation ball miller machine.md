 · Several types of ball mills exist. They differ to an extent in their operating principle. They also differ in their maximum capacity of the milling vessel ranging from 0.010 liters for planetary ball mills mixer mills or vibration ball mills to several 100 liters for horizontal rolling ball mills.

## How to measure viscosity :: Anton Paar Wiki
How the rolling-ball principle works. A ball of known dimensions rolls or falls through a closed capillary which contains the sample liquid. A preset angle determines the inclination of the capillary. The time it takes the ball to descend a defined distance within the fluid is directly related to the fluid's viscosity.
