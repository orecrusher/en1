## What is Cylindrical Grinding 
What is Cylindrical Grinding – Steps in Cylindrical Grinding. Grinding is the process of removing metal by the appliion of abrasives which are bonded to form a rotating wheel. When the moving abrasive particles contact the workpiece they act as tiny cutting tools each particle cutting a tiny chip from the workpiece.

## What Are the Basic Principles of Cylindrical Grinding?
Grinding this part reduces the intensity of the friction it will be subjected to. The shaft therefore becomes more durable and reliable. Cylindrical grinding is also used in areas with particularly high technical requirements. Many industrial machines have ground parts as do the vast majority of engines.
