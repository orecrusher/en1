## Frac Sand Mining 
Frac Sand Mining. Hydraulic fracturing uses high pressure water to break open underground geologic formations – most commonly shale. – containing oil and gas. Once the shale is fractured if the fractures are not propped open they will close again. So frackers use frack sand to prop open the fractures to allow the oil and gas to be extracted.
