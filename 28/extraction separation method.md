## SEPARATION TECHNIQUES 
Separation techniques are those techniques that can be used to separate two different states of matter such as liquids and solids. Separation processes or a separation method or simply a separation is methodology to attain any mass transfer phenomenon that convert a mixture of substances into two or more distinct product mixtures.

 · Filtration. Filtration is a separation method used to separate out pure substances in mixtures comprised of particles—some of which are large enough in size to be captured with a porous material. Particle size can vary considerably given the type of mixture. For instance stream water is a mixture that contains naturally occurring biological organisms like bacteria viruses and protozoa.

## Extraction 
The simplest extraction method is a repeated extraction with fresh solvent (lateral flow extraction). However this is rarely used because of the costs of solvent and because it results in an extract of a very low concentration. The most common method used is countercurrent extraction either in a batch or continuous process.
