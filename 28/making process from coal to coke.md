## Coking Coal 
Coke making is extremely problematic from an environmental perspective as many of the hydrocarbons driven off during the coking process are hazardous. Also not all types of coal are suitable for the production of coke. The impurities in coal affects the quality of coke produced.

 · Coal to Make Coke and Steel Metallurgical coal (also called "met" coal) is an important raw material used in the steel-making process although very small amounts of coal (relative to the amount used for electricity) are needed. The coal used to make steel is heated without air in an oven at temperatures of as much as 2060°F (1125°F) until most of its volatile matter is released.

 · From there the coal is converted into coke and then used in the blast furnace-basic oxygen steelmaking process. Coal does three things in this process: it is burned to supply the huge amounts of heat required it supplies gases to strip oxygen from the iron ore and roughly 1% of the coal ends up as carbon in the steel.

 · Coke making process involves carbonization of coal to high temperatures in an oxygen deficient atmosphere to concentrate the carbon. The volatile constituents of the coal including water coal–gas and coal–tar are driven off by baking in an airless oven at temperatures as high as 1000 °C so that the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together.
