## Trommel screen 
A trommel screen also known as a rotary screen is a mechanical screening machine used to separate materials mainly in the mineral and solid-waste processing industries. It consists of a perforated cylindrical drum that is normally elevated at an angle at the feed end. Physical size separation is achieved as the feed material spirals down the rotating drum where the undersized material

## Sieve Sizes: U.S. and Metric Sizes 
Sieve mesh sizes are based on dimensions of the mesh size opening or on the number of openings per linear inch. The two major standards governing test sieves and appropriate sizes are ASTM E11 and ISO 565/3310-1 both of which specify parameters for aperture dimensions mesh size and statistical variations. Opening sizes and mesh diameters for test sieves are often duplied between these

## Trommels 101 : Understanding Trommel Screen Design
Mesh Screen Designs â€“ this type of design is weaker than a perforated plate design and is more prone to damage and wear. For this reason many mesh designs utilise replaceable screen sections. Cleaning is more difficult with mesh designs due to entrapment of material on mesh ridges and in broken/damaged sections of the mesh.

Sieves and screens are usually used for larger particle sized materials greater than 44 micron (325 Mesh). Two scales are used to classify particle sizes; US Sieve Series and Tyler Mesh Size. A powder's mesh size can at times be somewhat confusing. A -6 mesh powder contains particles that pass through a 6 mesh screen.

Mesh size is measured by how many threads of mesh there are crossing per square inch. For instance a 110 mesh screen has 110 threads crossing per square inch. The higher the mesh count the finer the threads and holes are in the screen. The size of the mesh has a lot to do with how detailed your image is and how thick the ink you are using is.
