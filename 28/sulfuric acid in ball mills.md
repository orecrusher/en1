Waste acid from the hydrolysis of titanyl sulfate is not strong enough for direct reuse in the process. The mixture includes 20 - 23% sulfuric acid as well as residue water and impurities such as iron sulfate (FeSO 4). The addition of either lime or limestone will react with the sulfuric acid to create calcium sulfite (CaSO 3). The reaction is

 · The standard procedures used for all these tests are described here. The ore was wet ground to the target size using a laboratory ball mill and the slurry was adjusted to the desired percentage of solids. Next the slurry was conditioned using concentrated sulfuric acid and then autoclaved for the required time at the chosen temperature.

Commonly sulfuric acid is used as a leachant for copper oxide although it is possible to use water particularly for ores rich in ultra-soluble sulfate minerals. [ citation needed ] In general froth flotation is not used to concentrate copper oxide ores as oxide minerals are not responsive to the froth flotation chemicals or process (i.e.; they do not bind to the kerosene-based chemicals).
