## Dolomite 
Dolomite is used as an ornamental stone as a raw material for the manufacture of cement and as a source of magnesium oxide. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals (that is readily oxidized metals) such as lead zinc and copper .
