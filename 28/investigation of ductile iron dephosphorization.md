## Investigations of the Dephosphorization of Liquid Iron 
 · The dephosphorization of liquid iron in the presence of high Cr concentration is important not only for stainless steels but also for the production of low-phosphorus ferrochrome. In conventional stainless steel technologies the phosphorus problem is generally related not only to metallic charge materials such as scrap or alloys but also to the low quality of slag-forming materials mainly

## TEM investigation of ductile iron alloyed with vanadium 
 · The ductile iron was austenitized closed to the solidus (1095°C) for 100 h cooled down to 640°C and held on at this temperature for 16 h. The heat treatment led to the dissolution of primary vanadium-rich carbides and their subsequent re-precipitation in a more dispersed form.
