Copper processing - Copper processing - Ores: Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper porphyry copper massive deposits and mixed ores. Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature. Occasionally copper is still found in its native form but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals some of which may have value themselves.

The blast or shaft furnace is well-suited for smelting high-grade lumpy copper ore. If only fine concentrates are available they must first be agglomerated by briquetting pelletizing or sintering. Because of this additional step and its overall low efficiency the blast furnace lost its importance for primary copper production and is currently used in only a few places for example Glogow in Poland.
