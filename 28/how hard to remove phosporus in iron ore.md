## Removal of phosphorus
 · A new approach of removing the phosphorus-rich phase from high-phosphorous iron ore by melt separation at 1573 K in a super- gravity field was investigated. The iron-slag separation by super-gravity resulted in phosphorus being effectively removed from the iron-rich phase and concentrated as a phosphorus-rich phase at a temperature below the melting point of iron.

## The Removal of Iron From Hard Pulverised Kaolin by Dry 
Deposits of hard kaolin are abundant in China with kaolin content in the ore exceeding 95%. It is however rather difficult to remove iron from the ore. It was demonstrated that wet high–gradient magnetic separation is very efficient in removing the iron compounds from kaolin. For hard kaolin however dry high–gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) may be more suitable.

## Removal of Phosphorus from High Phosphorus Iron Ores in 
In the process of resource utilization of high phosphorus iron ores phosphorus should be removed first. Compared to other dephosphorization methods selective leaching with acid has special advantages such as high dephosphorization ratio low iron loss and so on. However a large amount of acidic wastewater containing phosphorus was produced after acid leaching.
