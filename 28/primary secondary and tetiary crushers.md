## Primary Crusher 
Crushing is typically a dry operation that is performed in two- or three-stages (i.e. primary secondary tertiary crushing). Lumps of run-of-mine ore as large as 1.5 m across are reduced in the primary crushing stage to 10–20 cm in heavy-duty machines. In most operations the primary crushing schedule is the same as the mining schedule.
