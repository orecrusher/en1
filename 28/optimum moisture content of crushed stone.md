 · Since moisture content variation of 1–2% from optimum during field compaction is common it was planned to have samples with moisture contents covering ±1.5% of the optimum. Then soaked CBR tests were conducted on all compacted samples after they were placed in a bath of water for four days per AASHTO T193.

## Maximum Dry Density of Soil and Optimum Moisture Content Test
The Optimum moisture content (OMC) or Optimum Water Content (OWC) is the moisture content at which the soil attains maximum dry density. This OMC value is with respect to the specific amount of compaction energy applied to the soil. Scope of Standard Proctor Compaction Test.

The influence of grading and the shape and texture of the aggregates on compactabllIty was evaluated and a method was given whereby the compactability of crushed stone can be predicted. The influence of moisture content was also investigated and it was found that the optimum moisture content is often at or near the saturation point.
