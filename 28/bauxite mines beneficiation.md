## Bauxite Deposits 
Bauxite deposits invariably contain a range of impurities ranging from organic material to trace elements such as Ga Zn Pb P and Be. Table 2.1 shows typical compositions of a range of smelter aluminas. In the Bayer process many impurities are at least partially soluble in the caustic digestion liquor and may be carried over into precipitation if they are not removed in the desiliion
