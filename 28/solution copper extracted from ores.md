Many metals are impure when they are extracted from their ores. Impurities have to be removed. Copper is purified by electrolysis. In this process copper is transferred from an impure anode to the hode of an electrolytic cell. The insoluble impurities fall to the bottom. The copper produced by this process is 99.99% pure copper.
