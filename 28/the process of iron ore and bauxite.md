## IRON REMOVAL FROM BAUXITE ORES 
A process of removing iron from bauxite ore is described. The ore is firstly reduced in CO and H 2 atmosphere to convert iron contamination of bauxite to magnetite or elemental iron. Then material is finely crushed and passed through the magnetic separation. Short characterisation of green and preheated bauxite is done by using XRD XRF and EPMA.

## A Booming Bauxite Mining Industry of Guinea and Future 
 · Abstract:Guinea with bauxite potential of about 40 billion tons is the largest aluminium ore exporter in the world today.During 2019 the country exported about 70 million tons of bauxite which is likely to exceed 110 million tons by 2021. This may substantially change the present bauxite market and significantly affect other bauxite producing countries of the world.

## Red mud (bauxite residue) – an unnecessary problem? 
 · Global annual production of red mud (bauxite residue) is about 150 million tonnes. It contains raw materials for the production of iron silicon and aluminium and is dumped as waste in spite of the availability of recycling technologiesbauxite residu. This is because it is cheaper to dump bauxite residue as waste and continue mining for new ores.
