High cone angles are typically used to achieve very coarse particle size separations Longer 10 ° cones achieve higher retention times and finer more efficient size separations. Recently Krebs Engineers developed the qMax cyclone which incorporates a dual slope cone i.e. a 10 ° at the interface between the cylinder and the cone and a 6 ° angle at the bottom of the cone.

Particles of higher density or larger size typically travel at a faster rate and at some point will be separated from particles less dense or smaller.
