 · Moving gravel miners out of the river and onto the floodplain is often seen as a safer option but there are substantial risks. We reviewed local national and international case studies of floodplain gravel mines and found 37 documented examples where rivers had diverted through mining pits causing erosion and in some cases loss of infrastructure such as bridges.
