## Development of a new fine particle dry separator 
 · Dry coal cleaning has generated renewed interest in scientific and coal mining communities alike due to water scarcity in many parts of the world and the numerous tailings ponds that have resulted from traditional wet coal preparation methods. Commercially available dry separation technologies such as air tables and air jigs are mostly effective in cleaning coarse coal with particle size

This paper proposes pre-beneficiation studies by air jigs of the coal layers from a Moatize coal deposit. Pre-beneficiation also called destoning removes tailings before the beneficiation plant. The air jigs operate in the same granulometric size range as the heavy-media cyclones (HMCs) that are installed in the preparation plant. With the destoning the heavy-media circuit operates with a
