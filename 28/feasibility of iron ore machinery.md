## Reduction of Iron Oxides with Hydrogen—A Review 
Iron ores always contain some additional gangue. The type and amount depend on the iron ore itself and the beneficiation process. Typical remaining oxides are SiO 2 CaO MgO and Al 2 O 3. Wang and Sohn 43 investigated the effect of CaO and SiO 2 on swelling and iron whisker formation during the reduction of iron oxide compacts.

The iron ore and coke is added to a process designed to release oxygen from the iron ore according to the simplified reaction: iron ore + carbon => iron + carbon dioxide. This takes place in a shaft furnace where the solids are charged to the top of the furnace and preheated air is injected in the lower parts to enable an efficient heat transfer.
