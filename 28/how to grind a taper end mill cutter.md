Center cutting end mills are essential for plunge milling. Non-center cutting end mills have cutting edges only on the sides and are used only for side milling. These tools are identified by a small hole at the center. Roughing end mills have serrations in the teeth to quickly remove large amounts of material without creating vibration.
