## Hydroelectric Power: How it Works 
 · Falling water produces hydroelectric power. The theory is to build a dam on a large river that has a large drop in elevation (there are not many hydroelectric plants in Kansas or Florida). The dam stores lots of water behind it in the reservoir. Near the bottom of the dam wall there is the water intake.

A major advantage that the automatic plant watering system has is that it is equipped with both a USB and a battery supply. You don't have to worry that the charger was knocked out of the socket whilst you aren't home and that your plants may be dehydrated. The pump runs by a micro USB and 4 AA batteries as a contingency.

## Cooling water pump 
Cooling water pumps are used for supplying heat exchangers with cooling water. Their flow rate varies depending on the heat flow to be dissipated. The required head is determined by the type of cooling system. A distinction is made between wet cooling and dry cooling processes. Range of head and flow rate The required heads for fresh water operation usually lie within 5 to 15 m. In cooling

## Boiler feed water and booster pumps 
Feed water pumps (FWP) pump the feed water from the de-aerator through the HP heaters to the boiler. The major characteristic of FWP is their high differential head. In medium to large size coal- and oil-fired power plants the main FWP are horizontal barrel type while booster pumps are horizontal single stage double suction type.

## Centrifugal Pump 
Centrifugal pumps are used to induce flow or raise a liquid from a low level to a high level. These pumps work on a very simple mechanism. A centrifugal pump converts rotational energy often from a motor to energy in a moving fluid. The two main parts that are responsible for the conversion of energy are the impeller and the casing.

 · Pump selection and sizing. The BFW pump capacity is established by adding to the maximum boiler flow a margin to cover boiler operating swings and eventual capacity reduction in capacity caused by wear. This margin likely will be between 20% and 25% for small and medium plants and around 15% for very large plants.
