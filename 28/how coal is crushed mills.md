 · Milling machines crush asphalt to a specified depth and further vacuum the ground material. You can use the milled asphalt by applying it on your driveway or road surface and then compressed it. The milled asphalt can form a surface nearly as strong as paving with a hot asphalt mix if compacted; hence you can also use it as a foundation for subsequent paving with tar and chip or hot

## How Coal Works 
 · If coal is high in sulfur or other impurities it is washed with a water or chemical bath removing up to 40 percent of inorganic sulfur in the coal. Not all coal is prepared using the same process. High-sulfur coal commonly undergoes washing to meet environmental regulations while low-sulfur coal is often crushed and resized without being washed.

Crushed coal from the raw coal bunker is fed by gravity to a dryer where hot air is passed through the coal to dry it. The dryer may use waste flue gasses preheated air or bleeder steam as drying agent. The dry coal is then transferred to the pulverising mill. The pulverised coal obtained is transferred to the pulverised coal bunker (bin).
