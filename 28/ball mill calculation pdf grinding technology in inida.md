Hardinge mill: In this type of ball mills the cylinder has a conical end towards a discharge point. In this mill the larger balls remain within the cylinder and the smaller balls are collected in the conical portion. As a result coarser grinding takes place in the cylinder portion and finer grinding takes place in the apex of the conical portion.
