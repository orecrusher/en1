## IMPACT STRENGTH OF BRITTLE MATERIALS (ROCKS)
The rock strength coefficient FN is graphically determined from the curve (FΝ Ν) and corresponds to the minimum value of the curve. This minimum value of FN is by definition the impact rock strength coefficient (FN) as representing the optimum specific crushing energy (minimum impact energy per unit volume of -0.5 mm material).
