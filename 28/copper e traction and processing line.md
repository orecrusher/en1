 · The dipping was done in room temperature and the beaker was hand-twirled to produce a swirling motion. After 3 minutes the resulting copper was removed from the beaker and sequentially dipped into 3 beakers of DI water for rinsing purpose. The whole rinsing process lasted around 10 seconds. The piece was then immediately dried with a paper towel.

On the outer layers of the PCB design this trend is reversed — clear ink refers to the line of copper pathways but black ink also refers to areas where the copper will be removed. Each PCB layer and the accompanying solder mask gets its own film so a simple two-layer PCB needs four sheets — one for each layer and one each for the accompanying solder mask.
