## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

## Grain losses in rice processing 
Further losses in the milling process are caused by poor technical performance of milling machinery or operator ineptitude resulting in poor milling yields. An example of a machine that has been eliminated in some countries is the Engleberg type single pass mill one step process notorious for breaking the grain in the milling process and yielding as only 53% milled rice.

 · If the ratio is good then the ball milling efficiency will be greatly improved. Generally there are large medium and small balls and the better ratio between them can also be obtained through experiments. 1 The consumption of mill balls is high. 2 The process of dehydration and drying increases the cost.

 · In Grinding selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum/ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do. Often the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case". Well this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and/or mill liner wear and tear.
