## Assessing the energy efficiency of a jaw crusher 
 · It is well known and taken for granted that the efficiency of energy use by comminution (i.e. breaking crushing grinding) equipment is very low typically less than 10%. Most of the process input power is dissipated as heat and noise and ineffective deformation of the material to be processed and the device itself.
