## Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking 
The pulp is treated with beating or refining to separate the fibers from each other and to roughen the surface of the fiber. Most papers do not use adhesives but rely on hydrogen bonding between fibers. Paper is then formed by running a dilute slurry of pulp through a screen and then most of the water is allowed to drain out by gravity.
