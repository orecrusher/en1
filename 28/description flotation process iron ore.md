## How iron is made 
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92-94% iron and 3-5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.

Flotation in mineral processing method used to separate and concentrate ores by altering their surfaces to a hydrophobic or hydrophilic condition—that is the surfaces are either repelled or attracted by water.The flotation process was developed on a commercial scale early in the 20th century to remove very fine mineral particles that formerly had gone to waste in gravity concentration plants.

Answer. Sulphide ores are concentrated by froth- flotation process. Only sulphide ores are concentrated by this method because pine oil selectively wets the sulphide ore and hence brings it to the froth. Answer verified by Toppr. 18 Views.

Iron oxide particles stick to the air bubbles and float. Floated and concentrated iron ore slurry is then skimmed from the surface of the bath and water is removed using a filter press. If the desired iron content is not achieved the process is repeated. A modifier is added in some cases to enhance the performance of the collector.
