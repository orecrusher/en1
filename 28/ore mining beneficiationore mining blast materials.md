## Could raw material shortages hinder the steel industry's 
 · As a result the quality of the DRI is closely related to the quality of iron ore inputs. DRI is therefore mostly made from very high-quality raw materials which can be produced at only a limited number of mines (Exhibit 3.) A significant expansion of the DRI industry will likely lead to a shortage of raw materials within the next decade.

## Mining and Mineral Use 
Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earth's surface. Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores. How underground mining is approached – from above below or sideways – depends on the placement of the ore body its depth concentration of ore and the strength of the surrounding rock.
