 · If you are powder coating your carbon steel the grinding process is nearly over for you. Just one more blending stage is required with the Norton Rapid Prep Vortex in Coarse grade. Powder painting is thick enough to mask the appearance of the remaining scratch created by the coarse gritted abrasive and it readily adheres to the surface of scratched carbon steel.

The s-Jet ® System (patent pending) is a new innovation in a line of consistent developments being made in the area of air jet milling. Final finenesses in the submicron range (example: d 50 0.2 µm) can now be achieved with fluidized bed jet mills. As opposed to conventional dry grinding processes with fluidized bed jet mills the s-Jet ® System uses superheated steam as its milling gas.

Grinding machine Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g. low surface roughness) and high accuracy of shape and dimension. As the accuracy in dimensions in grinding is of the order of 0.000025 mm in most appliions it tends to be a finishing operation and removes comparatively little metal about 0.25 to 0.50 mm depth.
