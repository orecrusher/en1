## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency 
 · Too large of an angle causes boiling in the crushing chamber. This is where the jaw plates cannot grip onto the rock and it keeps slipping up and down avoiding being crushed. The nip angle gets flatter as the machine is set tighter. The settings on a jaw crusher are designed to produce material ideal for secondary crushing.
