## 5.3.3.4.6. Screening designs 
Screening designs are typically of resolution III. The reason is that resolution III designs permit one to explore the effects of many factors with an efficient number of runs. Sometimes designs of resolution IV are also used for screening designs. In these designs main effects are confounded with at worst three-factor interactions.
