 · Pneumatic Conveying Systems for Bulk Materials. Many material-handling plants transfer large quantities of materials often over long distances. As a result the conveying system's power consumption is of prime importance. In pneumatic conveying power consumption is a function of the system design transfer rate and convey length.
