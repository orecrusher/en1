## What Is Rubble Masonry 
 · Stones are utilized as obtained from the quarry thus making it the cheapest masonry construction as it saves the cost of dressing the stones. But as the stones are undressed they vary in shape and size to a large extent. This results in poor bonding between the stones. This makes it the weakest masonry in terms of strength.
