## Historical lead mine sites in Pa. studied
 · Another wave of lead mining followed in the 1800's and miners sought zinc in the area a few decades ago. Nevertheless scientific evidence could be a step forward for Fort Roberdeau - long called "the lead mine fort" even as its namesake mines remain unidentified. "We have always wondered where the original mines were" Morrow said.

Galena was booming in the early 19th century due to a high demand for lead and being the richest lead-bearing region in the world with the purest quality known the city's primary income source was lead mining however by the mid 19th century the demand for lead declined and Galena's population dropped from 14000 to 3396 by the late 21st

Magpie Mine. The heyday of lead mining in the Peak was the 18th century which saw the greatest volume of ore recovered and major new veins such as that under Eyam Edge opened up. By the end of the century many of the mines were quite deep and drainage had become a serious problem for water problems plagued most of the mines

Galena is often mined for its silver content. Galena is a semiconductor with a small bandgap of about 0.4 eV which found use in early wireless communiion systems.

 · Lead is a relatively soft malleable blue-grey heavy metal and is probably the earliest discovered metal that does not occur naturally in its pure state. Galena (PbS) is the principal ore mineral usually found in association with sphalerite (ZnS). Galena often contains inclusions of silver and is a major source of that metal.

Most salt mines operate underground but in salt deserts the rock salt is also mined at the surface. Two main methods of extracting rock salt are used in underground mining: Cut and blast mining consists in cutting slots at the base of the rock face. A series of carefully sited holes are drilled and then charged with explosives to blast the rock.
