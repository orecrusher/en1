 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

 · Iron is displaced from its ore (haematite) by carbon (from coke): 2Fe2O3 + 3C → 4Fe + 3CO2. Also displaced by carbon monoxide: Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2. Iron burns in hot air blast to form CO 2 (exothermic): C + O 2 → CO 2. At high temperatures in the furnaceCO 2 is reduced to CO: CO 2 + C → 2CO. Limestone reacts with impurities to form slag which is tapped off.
