 · All 3 M20 M21 M22 came with the same part # shaft. I took my M20 gears out and swapped them for M22 gears and the shaft remained the same. Rock crushers in a mine were strong cut teeth most likely on a small angle which gave it the name. Last edited: Jun 19 2012. Jun 20 2012 #8.

Muncie also had a second close-ratio transmission designated M22 and often referred to as the "rock-crusher" which was used behind the highest-performance engines and in Corvettes the M22 is a highly sought-after performance transmission. It is the heavy-duty version of the 2.20:1 ratio M21 four-speed.
