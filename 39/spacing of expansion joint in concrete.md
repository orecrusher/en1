Under most normal concrete paving situations these criteria do not apply. Therefore expansion joints should not normally be used.

 · A concrete expansion joint – or control joint – is a gap which allows the concrete to expand and contract as/when the temperature changes. It forms a break between the concrete and other parts of a structure to allow movement without causing stress which can lead to cracking.

When working with concrete you should use fibreboard which offers flexibility across the surface of concrete allowing movement that will prevent cracking.
