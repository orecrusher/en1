## Fabriion and Special Finishing Methods
 · Grinding. In finishing the dividing line between fine grinding and polishing is not always clear because both involve metal removal. Coarse or rough grinding like a fine milling operation removes excess metal from weld beads flash on forgings or run-outs on castings. Coarse or rough grinding is also used in centreless grinding of bars.
