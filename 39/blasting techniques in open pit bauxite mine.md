## Optimization of blasting design parameters on open pit 
 · In open pit mining where rock is hard such thatit requires drilling and blasting techniques to be applied for it to be mineable the overall cost-effectiveness of the production operations requires that drilling and blasting be optimized. Mining costs for unit operations which includes loading hauling crushing costs reduce with increasing rock fragmentation sizes. Quality of blast results in open pit bench blasting plays a key effect on the efficiency and cost of drilling and blasting and subsequently mining

 · Open-pit Mining Open-pit mining also known as opencast mining open-cut mining and strip mining means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.
