## Forged Irons vs. Cast Irons 
 · The casting process: When a golf iron is cast the metal used to make the iron is heated to its melting point becoming a liquid.It is then poured into molds of the iron heads. When it cools and hardens voila you have golf irons. The forging process: When a golf iron is forged the solid metal of the clubhead is literally pounded or compressed until it takes the desired shape.

 · Each mill measures about 12 metres in diameter and has an internal volume of 1220 cubic metres. As the AG mill turns the ore crushes against itself and breaks apart. From the AG mills the ore travels to the primary magnetic separators where the iron is drawn away from the waste material before it's screened and fed into the ball mills.
