## Mining and milling 
 · During milling the uranium bearing ore is initially crushed (if preceded by conventional mining) which is typically a dry process and then ground into a slurry which is a wet process. The intent of crushing and grinding is to effectively increase the surface area to volume ratio of the material which facilitates chemical leaching.

 · For mining and milling of uranium a distinction is made between conventional mining and in situ leach (ISL) mining. A conventional mining operation consists of underground/or open pit operation and a process plant to extract the uranium from the host rock. An ISL operation consists of well fields and a process plant to extract the uranium.
