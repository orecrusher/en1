## What is Fly Ash Brick? its advantages and disadvantages 
These bricks do not cause any additional load for the design of structures and provide better earthquake resistance. It improves the strength over time and offers greater strength to the structure. 3. Thermal Properties: The thermal conductivity of fly ash bricks is 0.90 – 1.05 W/m2. They acquire less heat.

 · The compressive strength of flyash brick is three times greater than the normal clay brick. The minimum compressive strength of clay brick is 3.5 N/mm².So as the flyash brick has compressive strength of 10-12 N/mm². Bricks to be used for different works should not have compressive strength less than as mentioned above. The universal testing machine is used for testing the compressive strength of bricks.

Here the coconut coir is used as a replacement in the percentage of flyash. From the results it were found to be the strength gets increasing gradually on increase of days. When compared to the other mixes the strength increases due to the addition of fibre also weight of the brick remains same. The usage of the fibre creates a strong link inside the brick thus it holds the brick even it gets cracks at its normal state the further loading is carried by the fibre and makes the bricks to withstand heavy loadings. The addition of more coir then 5 C helps to increase the strength more but when it overs a certain percentage it makes the brick to lose strength.
