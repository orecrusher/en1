## What Is Mountaintop Removal Mining? 
 · Mountaintop removal coal mining often described as "strip mining on steroids" is an extremely destructive form of mining that is devastating Appalachia. In the past few decades over 2000 miles of streams and headwaters that provide drinking water for millions of Americans have been permanently buried and destroyed. An area the size of Delaware has been flattened. Local coal
