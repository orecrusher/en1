Traditional fine-grinding mills in mineral processing rely on the use of steel medium for particle size reduction. The IsaMill (a horizontal stirred mill with a 3000-L net chamber volume and a rated motor power of 1120 kW) has successfully adopted a novel product-separator design which has led to a major revision of medium use in fine grinding.
