## How is uranium made into nuclear fuel 
The vast majority of nuclear power reactors use the isotope uranium-235 as fuel; however it only makes up 0.7% of the natural uranium mined and must therefore be increased through a process called enrichment. This increases the uranium-235 concentration from 0.7% to between 3% and 5% which is the level used in most reactors.
