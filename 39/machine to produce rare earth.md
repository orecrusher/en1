## Ten Ways to Generate Electricity From Renewable Sources 
 · Geothermal energy works similarly to a large heat exchanger. Deep in the earth's crust heat from magma chambers and volcanic activity can be utilized to generate steam which can turn turbines. Alternatively natural steam rising from crustal vents in the ground can be captured and directed into a power generation facility.

 · Rare earth magnets (along with other types of permanent magnet) are always 'on' whether the electrical machine where they are used is operational or not. This means that when a rare earth magnet (or other magnet based motor) is rotating even with no electrical current applied magnetic flux will still be present within the machine.
