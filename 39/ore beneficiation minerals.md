## What Is Mineral Beneficiation? 
What is mineral beneficiation? Mineral beneficiation is a process by which valuable constituents of an ore are concentrated by means of a physical separation process. As one of the initial steps of extractive metallurgy the main purpose is to prepare the ore prior to downstream purifiion processes.

## Ore Beneficiation 
Crushing and screening is typically the first step of iron ore beneficiation processes. In most ores including iron ore valuable minerals are usually intergrown with gangue minerals so the minerals need to be separated in order to be liberated. This screening is an essential step prior to their separation into ore product and waste rock.
