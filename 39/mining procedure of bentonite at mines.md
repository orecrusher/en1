 · Bentonite is mined by surface "open pit" methods. Various types of heavy equipment including bull dozers and rubber-tired scrapers are used to remove the shale rock overlying the bentonite. Topsoil as well as the underlying material is cautiously removed and stockpiled. These "overburden" materials as they are called will be placed back and reseeded once the bentonite has been removed. The bentonite which is bare during this process can be as little as 1 1/2 feet or as much as 10 feet thick. This is the material which is mined

## Treatment of Acid Mine Drainage Using Un
 · Abstract—The use of un-activated bentonite and un-activated bentonite blended with limestone for the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) was investigated. Batch experiments were conducted in a 5 L PVC reactor. Un-activated bentonite on its own did not effectively neutralize and remove heavy metals from AMD. The final pH obtained was below 4 and the metal removal efficiency was below 50% for all the metals when bentonite solid loadings of 1 5 and 10% were used. With un-activated bentonite (1%) blended with 1% limestone the final pH obtained was approximately 7 and metal removal efficiencies were greater than 60% for most of the metals. The Langmuir isotherm gave the best fit for the experimental data giving correlation coefficient (R2) very close to 1. Thus it was concluded that un-activated bentonite
