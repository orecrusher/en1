## Projected Costs of Generating Electricity 2020 
 · The cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants remains stable yet electricity from the long-term operation of nuclear power plants constitutes the least cost option for low-carbon generation. At the assumed carbon price of USD 30 per tonne of CO2 and pending a breakthrough in carbon capture and storage coal-fired power generation is slipping out of the competitive range.

## Power Generation from Coal 
Coal is the biggest single source of energy for electricity production and its share is growing. The efficiency of converting coal into electricity matters: more efficient power plants use less fuel and emit less climate-damaging carbon dioxide. This book explores how efficiency is measured and reported at coal-fired power plants.
