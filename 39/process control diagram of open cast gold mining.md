## Open Pit Mining Techniques
 · Open-pit Mining Open-pit mining also known as opencast mining open-cut mining and strip mining means a process of digging out rock or minerals from the earth by their elimination from an open pit or borrow. The word is used to distinguish this type of mining from extractive methods that need tunneling into the earth.
