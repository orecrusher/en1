During this campaign we mined 773300 tonnes of ore with an average grade of 15.4 per cent REO. We stockpiled this ore on site according to its grade and mineralogy ready for downstream processing. In September 2011 we were granted permission by the Western Australian authorities to extend our drilling program to the western side of the Central Lanthanide deposit.
