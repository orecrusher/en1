## What is a Cone Crusher
How A Cone Crusher Works. The moving cone of the cone crusher performs a swing motion under the action of the eccentric sleeve. The material is continuously squeezed impacted and broken in the crushing cavity formed by the bowl liner and the mantle liner and falls from the mantle swing gap that meets the discharge requirements.

In a "bale" crusher another set of pistons pushes another crushing plate in a lateral direction. Once the car has been crushed flat it's crushed sideways forming a "hay bale" of compacted car. Some baler crushers use specially shaped "claws" that fold the cars into bales or square logs. You can view this diagram showing how this works.

The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended as in the gyratory but is supported in a curved universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.
