Silica sand is mainly used because of its thermal conductivity. It can absorb and transmit heat while allowing the gases generated during the thermal degradation of binders to pass through the grains. As a molding material the sand is compacted and shaped according to the mold pattern that is going to be produced as well as to create cavities.
