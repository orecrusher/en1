During ironmaking iron ore coke heated air and limestone or other fluxes are fed into a blast furnace. The heated air causes the coke combustion which provides the heat and carbon sources for iron production. Limestone or other fluxes may be added to react with and remove the acidic impurities called slag from the molten iron.
