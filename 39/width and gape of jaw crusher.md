 · The gape determines the maximum size of material that can be accepted. Maximum size that can be accepted into the crusher is approximately 80% of the gape. Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4:1 and 9:1. Gyratory crushers can produce size reduction ratios over a somewhat larger range of 3:1 to 10:1.
