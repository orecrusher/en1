The gold cyanidation process is a primary method of gold beneficiation. Activated carbon is a critical component in the beneficiation of gold ore allowing this widespread process to occur because of its ability to recover gold from the gold-cyanide complex. Depending on the deposit some silver ores may also be processed via cyanidation.

## What is Gold Cyanidation? (with picture) 
Gold cyanidation extracts gold from the ground. Gold cyanidation also called cyanide leaching is a process used to extract gold from raw ore taken from the ground. It uses cyanide to dissolve the gold within the rock which itself is not soluble in cyanide. The gold is then drawn out in a liquid form that can be treated to remove the cyanide.
