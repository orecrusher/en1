Particle density and bulk density are two basic ways to express sediment weight. Particle density is defined as the mass of a unit volume of sediment solids. A simple example is that if 1 cm 3 of solid material weighs 2.65 g the particle density is 2.65 g/cm 3. Particle densities generally fall between 2.60 and 2.75 g/cm 3 for mineral particles.
