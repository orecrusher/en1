## Continuous Casting (metallurgy) 
 · Continuous casting is the most efficient way to solidify large volumes of metal into simple shapes with consistent quality. It has been steadily replacing older ingot casting processes since it was developed in the 1950's and 60's. Compared with other casting processes continuous casting generally has a higher capital cost but lower operating cost. It produces "near-net shapes" that are closer to the final product shape so require less subsequent deformation. This makes continuous casting

## CiteSeerX — Modeling of Continuous
CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill Lee Giles Pradeep Teregowda): The quality of continuous-cast steel is greatly influenced by fluid flow in the mold particularly at the meniscus. Recent examples of computational model appliions at the University of Illinois are presented to investigate the formation of several different types of defects related to flow phenomena.

 · Metal mold casting is prone to have crack defects because the metal mold itself does not have concealing ability the cooling speed is quick it easily leads to increased internal stress of the casting. The opening type is too early or too late the pouring angle is too small or too large the coating layer is too thin etc also caused the cracks.

The oxide slag is mostly distributed on the casting surface near the inner runner in a network. Sometimes it is flaky or wrinkled irregular clouds or formed into flaky interlayers or exists inside the casting in the form of floccus. When breaking it often breaks from the interlayer and the oxide is one of the sources of cracks in the casting.
