## Chapter 4: Mining waste 
For example if the cut-off grade in the ore is 1 % Copper 99 percent of the total ore would be deposited as tailings. Iron ores generally have higher grades than sulfide or gold ores often going over 50 per cent or more. Less tailings are therefore generally produced in iron ore projects.

## Mineral Processing 
Mineral processing mineral beneficiation or upgradation involves handling three primary types of ROM material which have been blasted fragmented and brought out from an in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even by applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.

Iron Ore Beneficiation And Processing FundamentalsIron ore beneficiation is a multistage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content. The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals and these define the methods used to refine it.
