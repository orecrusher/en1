## Technological Problems Of Burning Low
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Technological problems of boiler operation do occur when western coals are burned in those boilers designed to handle midwestern or other types of coal. These problems have been identified for the following five boiler types: 1. Cross-feed stoker 2. Under-feed stoker 3. Spreader stoker 4.

Theoretically speaking if the wind speed of the nozzle ring of the coal vertical mill is sufficient the mill will not discharge slag it will only be full and finally the vibration will stop. However in actual production the wind speed of the nozzle ring cannot be increased indefinitely so slag discharge occurs.

To summarize the coal mill controls they may be divided basically into two major egories:. 1. To control the quality of coal being sent to the burners loed on the furnace walls. The word quality here means the temperature and fineness of the PF. The set temperature values are dependent on the percentage of volatile matter that exists in the main fuel.
