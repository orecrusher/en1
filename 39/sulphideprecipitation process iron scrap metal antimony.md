Lead shots are the small round pellets of lead used as projectiles in shotguns. Lead is the primary material for shots and bullets. Alloying with antimony makes them hard. For instance premium lead shots normally contain up to 6% antimony while others contain about 1-2%. In Bullets lead is almost entirely sheathed in a copper alloy jacket.
