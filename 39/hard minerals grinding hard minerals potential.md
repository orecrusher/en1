## Revolution in Platinum 
 · In general hard brittle ores with low to medium abrasiveness (in an HPGR) are most suitable to comminution in an HPGR. The larger the benefit the easier the decision can be made in favour of a 'new' (higher risk) technology. The growth of HPGR in minerals appliions clearly shows this phenomenon. The case for HPGR in hard rock appliions

 · Large-size media are required to fracture particularly hard particles in the mill charge; smaller media fill the voids and promote finer grinding. For continuous grind appliions or batch mill attending to media volume is advisable - maintaining a 40-45% media charge (of mill volume) and keeping throughput constant will provide best results.
