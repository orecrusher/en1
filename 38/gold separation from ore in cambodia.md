Ore sorting is also a simpler process with a small footprint. Benefits Of Dense Medium Separation. While dense medium separation can only rely on density to distinguish valuable materials from waste it has the advantage of being able to sort a wider range of particle sizes. With ore sorting the largest particle size should be no more than 3

## Extracting antimony from high arsenic and gold
 · Gold and arsenic were present in pyrite and arsenopyrite which were stable during the SE and were retained in the leaching residue. This laid the theoretical basis for separating antimony from gold and arsenic in the As-Au-Sb ore by SE. All the reagents were of analytical grade and all the aqueous solutions were prepared using distilled water.
