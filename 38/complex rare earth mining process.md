 · Increasing rare earth mining outside of China has reduced China's global share of mining down from 97.7% in 2010 to 62.9% in 2019. But mining is merely one piece of the puzzle. Ultimately the large majority of rare earth refining 80% resides in China. Therefore even rare earths mined overseas are sent to China for final processing.
