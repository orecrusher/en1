Scoria is relatively low in mas but in contrast to pumice all scoria has a specific gravity greater than 1 and sinks in water. The dry density of scoria is only 1.115 g/cm 3 much lighter than ordinary soil. It has a porosity of 57.8% and a crushing strength of 54.8%.

## What Is Coarse Aggregate 
Coarse Aggregates in concrete provides body and strength to the concrete and acts as a filler material which will give the homogeneous mass of the concrete.. Coarse aggregates are used in every Construction projects which includes the construction of roads Buildings Railway Tracks etc.. Coarse Aggregate in concrete was considered as chemically inactive and acts as a filler material only.

One of the main uses of scoria is in the production of lightweight aggregate. The scoria is crushed to desired sizes and sold for a variety of uses. Concrete made with scoria typically weighs about 100 pounds per cubic foot. This is a weight savings compared to concrete made with typical sand and gravel that weighs about 150 pounds per cubic foot.
