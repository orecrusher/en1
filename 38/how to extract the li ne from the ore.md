## How Underground Mining Works 
Underground mines are the alternative to surface mines. Surface mines excavate from the top down a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper -- uranium mines can reach 6500 feet or 2 kilometers.

Oxides are easier to reduce (for the reason see box). Thus isolation of metals from concentrated ore involves two major steps viz. (a) conversion to oxide and (b) reduction of the oxide to metal.
