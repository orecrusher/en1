## Copper processing 
Extraction and refining. The extraction of copper from ore is normally carried out in three major steps. The first step mineral processing is to liberate the copper minerals and remove waste constituents—such as alumina limestone pyrite and silica—so that the copper minerals and other nonferrous minerals of value are concentrated into a product containing between 20 and 30 percent copper.
