## What Are Jaw Crushers and How Do They Work? 
 · There are several other jaw crushers like bulldog jaw crushers and force feed jaw crushers. But for reference we'll focus on the two most widely-used jaw crushers in the mining industry. Down below we'll discuss how these pieces of equipment operate

## Jaw Crusher 
The gyratory crusher can just like a jaw crusher accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). – This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. – As is the case for jaw crushers there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.

Jaw crushers are typically used as primary crushers because they can take large and variable sized feed material so the original feed won't have to be blasted down to a fine size. Powerscreen jaws are designed to be significantly more reliable and have lower wear rates maximizing production and minimizing wear parts.
