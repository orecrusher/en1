## Cement Clinker Quality Control During Clinker Production 
Coal fines are usually prepared by air swept coal mill or vertical mill. In order to produce high-quality clinker the fineness of coal fines should be controlled at about 12% and its moisture content should be controlled within 1.0%. The machines that are usually used to dry the coal fines are rotary dryers.
