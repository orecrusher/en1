Furthermore what are concentric and eccentric contractions? Key Points. Isotonic contractions generate force by changing the length of the muscle and can be concentric contractions or eccentric contractions.A concentric contraction causes muscles to shorten thereby generating force.Eccentric contractions cause muscles to elongate in response to a greater opposing force.
