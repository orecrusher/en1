Abstract. This geochemical classifiion of granitic rocks is based upon three variables. These are FeO/(FeO + MgO) = Fe-number [or FeO tot /(FeO tot + MgO) = Fe ] the modified alkali–lime index (MALI) (Na 2 O + K 2 O – CaO) and the aluminum saturation index (ASI) [Al/(Ca – 1·67P + Na + K)]. The Fe-number (or Fe ) distinguishes ferroan granitoids which manifest strong iron
