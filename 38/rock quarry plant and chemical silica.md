## Health Hazards of Mining and Quarrying 
 · Freshly fractured silica dust appears to be more reactive and more hazardous than old or stale dust. This may be a consequence of a relatively higher surface charge on freshly formed particles. The most common processes that produce respirable silica dust in mining and quarrying are drilling blasting and cutting silica-containing rock.
