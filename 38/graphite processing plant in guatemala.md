The process of photosynthesis involves the absorption of CO 2 by plants to produce carbohydrates. The equation is as follows: CO 2 + H 2 O + energy (CH 2 O) n +O 2. Carbon compounds are passed along the food chain from the producers to consumers. The majority of the carbon exists in the body in the form of carbon dioxide through respiration.

## The Hazer Process: Commercial Demonstration Plant 
Need. The Hazer Process is a novel method to produce low emissions hydrogen from a renewable form of methane.. The process utilises methane as a feedstock to produce hydrogen – without producing CO 2 in the reaction process – instead capturing the carbon in the feedstock as solid graphite.. Using biogas as a feedstock for the Hazer process may result in significant carbon abatement.
