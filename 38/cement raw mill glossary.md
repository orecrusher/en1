Raw Mill Feeding. In the value stream map of cement manufacturing the raw mill feeding is an intermediate activity between Pre-homogenization and raw milling and has not been discussed separately by most of the authors. However in my opinion it remains and must remain as of pivotal importance so far as the quality assurance is considered.

## Raw Mill In Cement PlantCement Making Plant
This paper mainly introduces the raw mill in cement plant. In order to achieve the desired setting qualities in the finished product a quantity (2-8% but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) is added to the clinker and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement raw mill.

Cement raw material and cement clinkers mainly contain four oxides: calcium oxide or lime (CaO) silica (SiO 2) alumina (Al 2 O 3) and iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3). The cement clinkers quality is evaluated by the above four oxides. Hence ingredient ratio of cement raw material will affect the quality and property of cement clinker significantly.
