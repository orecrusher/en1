## Structure genesis and resources efficiency of dolomite 
 · In an ideal structure of dolomite alternating layers of Mg 2+ Ca 2+ are interspersed with CO 3 2− groups oriented normal to the c-axis () with a Mg/Ca molar ratio of 1 (stoichiometry) and an ordered arrangement.The larger radius Ca 2+ occupy A sites and the smaller radius Mg 2+ occupy B sites. The standard unit cell parameters of ideal dolomite are a = b = 4.8069 c = 16.0034 ().
