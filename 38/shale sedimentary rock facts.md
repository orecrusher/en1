## What are sedimentary rocks? 
 · Sedimentary rocks are formed from pre-existing rocks or pieces of once-living organisms. They form from deposits that accumulate on the Earth's surface. Sedimentary rocks often have distinctive layering or bedding. Many of the picturesque views of the desert southwest show mesas and arches made of layered sedimentary rock.Common Sedimentary Rocks:

## Shale 
Shale is a very fine-grained clastic sedimentary rock which is made up mostly of clay (defined as particles smaller than 1/256 mm) and which is fissile (tending to break along natural laminations or planes of weakness that are less than 1 cm thick). Generally shale occurs in thin layers or beds and represent low-energy environments such as: offshore deposits of mud in ancient seas in

## Gray Shale Sedimentary Rock 
Shale is often a red or gray rock made of mostly clay minerals. This sedimentary rock forms in quiet water setting such as lakes and the deep parts of the ocean. The clay particles settle on the bottom of the lake or ocean and harden into rock. Shale is very fine-grained and is believed to be one of the most abundant rock

 · Facts About Rocks. September 29 2012 Haripriya M 13 Comments. Fact 1: Rocks are of three types called: igneous sedimentary and metamorphic.Many pieces of rock and soil that are broken from larger rocks slowly settle down into layers. In the course of time these layers will come together and form a hardened rock called sedimentary rock.

## What are sedimentary rocks? Shale and limestone 
 · By about 3.9 billion years ago (just a little less than four billion years ago) these loose bits of dirt and sand began to clump together again to make new rocks. These were the first sedimentary rocks. Water forms sedimentary rocks. Most sedimentary rock forms in water where the weight of the water presses down on the layers of sand and clay.The weight squashes them together into a new rock.
