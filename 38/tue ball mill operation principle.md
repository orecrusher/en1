 · Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling slotting making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.

 · The mill discharge from these mills consists of slurry which goes to the ball mills for further grinding and coarse pebbles/rocks which are crushed and sent back to the mill. To maximize the capacity of these circuits the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the pebble removal.

## How a Ball Screw Works 
How A Ball Screw Works A. The Ball Screw Assembly. The ball screw assembly consists of a screw and a nut each with matching helical grooves and balls which roll between these grooves providing the only contact between the nut and the screw. As the screw or nut rotates the balls are deflected by the deflector into the ball return system of the nut and they travel through the return system to

The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
