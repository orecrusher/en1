 · Wide reserves of iron ore is found in India which is the basic raw material for iron and steel industry. Draft National Steel Policy 2012 of India envisages the ambitious goal of the nation to reach a production capacity of 300 Mt/yr of crude quality steel by 2025 - 26. So the corresponding demand of iron ore containing 62 - 64 % Fe would be around 490 Mt (excluding our export requirement). To cope up with increasing global and domestic market demand and to achieve the goals of National Steel Policy our steel industry is in need of large quantity of iron ore.
