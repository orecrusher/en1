## Mining and its effect on environment 
 · Mining and industrial development as well as globalization has raised the spectre of destruction of the environment and threat of the dumping of toxic waste in developing countries. The government of Ghana recognizing the need to protect of the environment as a human right issue guaranteed this in the 1992 Constitution of Ghana.

## The Effect of Illegal Mining Activities on Vegetation: A 
 · The study showed that mining activities have resulted in the reduction of vegetation cover in Bontefufuo area. Generally in all the four mining towns the number of trees and shrubs were reduced compared to those in the unmined area. The average tree cover in the mined areas of Bontefufuo was reduced by 88.42% in the illegally mined areas. The average shrub cover in the mined areas of Bontefufuo was reduced by 60.54% in the illegally mined areas. Though the herb population increased in the mined area their cover was almost negligible since their sizes were so small to make an impact in terms of vegetation cover. The accumulated gravels and laterites spread on the soil coupled with compaction of the soil through human movements prevented the growth of vegetation. The forest removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis; therefore vegetation degradation through illegal mining
