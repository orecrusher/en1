## Mechanical Alloying: A Novel Technique to Synthesize 
Mechanical alloying is a solid-state powder processing technique that involves repeated cold welding fracturing and rewelding of powder particles in a high-energy ball mill. Originally developed about 50 years ago to produce oxide-dispersion-strengthened Ni- and Fe-based superalloys for aerospace and high temperature appliions it is now recognized as an important technique to synthesize
