## Crushers 
Figure 8.1 shows two basic types of jaw crushers: single toggle and double toggle. In the single toggle jaw crusher an eccentric shaft is installed on the top of the crusher. Shaft rotation causes along with the toggle plate a compressive action of the moving jaw. A double toggle crusher has basically two shafts and two toggle plates.
