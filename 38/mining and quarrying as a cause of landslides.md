 · Landslide is very common in the Shimla district due to quarrying activities. The quarrying of stone is done on middle and lower slopes. It is not kept in mind the stability of terrain during quarrying. The cutting of slope at the toe has destabilized the resistance force at many places as a consequence the upper portion moves downwards.

 · A question that has arisen a few times about the Tumbi Quarry landslide in Papua New Guinea is why it is that a quarry can increase landslide occurrence. The first point to be made is that many quarries when properly managed do not cause slope instability. However some of the most spectacular landslides are caused by mines or quarries.
