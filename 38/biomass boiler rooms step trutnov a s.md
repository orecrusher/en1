## Combustion models for biomass: A review 
 · 2. Biomass drying models. The first stage during biomass fuel combustion particle drying involves the removal of H 2 O from the solid fuel particle. Biomass particles generally increase temperature at a rates between 100 K/s to 1000 K/s depending on several factors when injected into the furnace hence the time taken to complete the drying process is very small .
