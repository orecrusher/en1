## Platinum Ore 
 · Platinum ore is an ore that yields platinum and small amounts of iridium. It is unobtainable by default. Obtaining. Platinum ore does not occur in the world by default and thus cannot be legitimately obtained. However it may be configured to generate in the world in modpacks. Platinum ore must be mined with a diamond pickaxe or better.

 · Extracting platinum from ore is both capital and labor-intensive. It can take up to 6 months and 7 to 12 tons of ore to produce one troy ounce (31.135g) of pure platinum. The first step in this process is to crush platinum containing ore and immerse it in the reagent containing water; a process known as 'froth flotation'.

 · In the case of multiple processing options cut-off grade is used to determine which process or destination the ore will be sent to by using the following equation: Where U1 is the utility of sending ore to process 1 and U2 is the utility of sending ore to process 2. Utility is defined as the value (economic or otherwise) of selecting a process.

Palladium (Pd) refining can be a daunting task similar to the other Platinum group metals (PGM's) refining process. This is mainly due to their similar (but different) physical and chemical properties. Separating Palladium from base metals and especially from sister PGM's is rarely achieved completely in one refining cycle. Sounds kind of rough but rest assured that this process is doable
