 · Moving the logs is a key consideration so the fact you have the means to do that is important if you decide on a bandsaw mill. I use a chainsaw mill because I have trouble moving logs. I minimize waste by milling everything 9/4 after drying I resaw on my bandsaw in my shop this is one way I get around the waste factor.

## Brand X sawmill comment 
 · As to price the mill in the US is lower than any 8" other swingmill. Often you can't really purchase a Lucas or Peterson unless you purchase their tracks. That is not the same for Brand X. A difference in this machine design is that it uses a work table yes logs need to be handled some folks use the attachable log deck.

Smaller logs you can saw perfectly well but you won't get the production figures that you will on the big logs. But that's true on any mill. Just give a bit of thought to the log handling log support bunks and some sort of dogging system. Something like the Gripperdogs over on the sponsor's list makes small log sawing a lot easier.

## Taking the Mystery Out of Swingmill Blades: Manufacturer's 
 · A swingmill has a single circular blade that pivots. It moves forward sawing in a horizontal plane to make the first cut pivots to the vertical plane at the end of the log and then moves back to its starting position as it saws in the vertical plane. Your dimensional board can now be removed from the log completely edged and square.
