## Extraction of gold using cyanide 
 · Extraction of gold using cyanide Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ore from which it is mined. To collect the gold from the ore it needs to be separated from the other minerals in the ore. To do this the gold needs to be made into a soluble form so that it can be separated from the other minerals as gold is insoluble.

## The Extraction of Copper 
 · Copper can be extracted from non-sulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulfate solution. Concentration of the copper(II) sulfate solution by solvent extraction.

Froth flotation (figure 2) is the most widely used concentration method and is normally the first step in the mineral processing sequence where chemical reagents are introduced (Vick 1990).
