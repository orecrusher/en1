## Froth flotation 
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
