## Assessing potential hydrogen cyanide exposure from 
This study assessed the effectiveness of the current cyanide management practice of a large gold mine as a case study of Thailand's cyanide-contaminated mine waste management policy. Most gold mines worldwide use cyanide to extract gold from ore and various cyanide compounds including hydrogen cyanide (HCN) are then discharged into a tailing

## Cyanide in mining 
Sodium cyanide used in mining is far from similar even in low concentrations to cyanogen compounds present in certain plants in nature. The scientific studies of Ronald Eisler (U.S. Geological Survey) and others: annually more than 20000 tons of hydrogen cyanide are released into the atmosphere from the gold mining.

## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining 
Cyanide's efficiency makes mining more wasteful. Because cyanide leaching is very efficient it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades. Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used;

Though Mudd believes: "Cyanide can be managedHowever it does require a lot of due diligence and careful attention.". "Using best practices and auditing is the best thing and mining companies are doing that" agrees Blackmore.

Cyanide Process. Cyanide process is also called as Macarthur-forest Process. It is the process of extracting gold or silver from the ores by dissolving in a dilute solution of potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide. This process was introduced in the year 1887 by the Scottish chemists naming Robert W. Forrest John S. MacArthur and William Forrest.

 · The mining industry has been using cyanide in their metal recovery processes for over 100 years. During this time the mining industry has found several ways to destroy and recover the cyanide from their processes. However due to cyanide's toxicity and potentially devastating environmental effects it is still a major environmental concern.

## Passive treatment for the removal of residual cyanide in 
 · In the gold mining industry tailings from the cyanide leaching process contain variable quantities of a number of cyanide compounds; as tailings are transferred to a pond for sedimentation and consolidation of the solid fraction the supernatant water contains residual cyanide. A natural degradation of cyanide in tailings ponds is reported in the specialised bibliography but in most cases this is not sufficient to reduce the residual cyanide concentration to levels which would allow these waters to be directly discharged into the existing receiving water courses. In order to develop low cost and environmental friendly long-term methods for treating leachates from tailing ponds wetland-based passive systems have been tested at the site of a gold mine
