## Coal mining and transportation 
 · Mining coalCoal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits called coal beds or seams are near the earth's surface while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## 11.10 Coal Cleaning 
 · Fine coal processing and coarse coal processing use similar operations and equipment to separate the contaminants. The primary difference is the severity of operating parameters. The majority of coal cleaning processes use upward currents or pulses of a fluid such as water to fluidize a bed of crushed coal and impurities.

 · Coal Carbonization (Coking). The second largest use of coal is the manufacture ofcoke for the metallurgical industry. Iron and its alloys (particularly the various kinds ofsteel) are perhaps the most versatile metallic construction materials known to humankind.Unfortunately iron occurs in nature not as metallic iron but rather in ores containing ironcompounds such as oxides or carbonates. The production of metallic iron requires achemical reaction to remove the oxygen from the iron compounds and liberate the iron

## An Introduction to CO2 Separation and Capture 
 · 3 The flue gas approaches in use today require clean-up of the NO x and SO 2 prior to CO 2 separation. The oxygen route does not. If the sinks are tolerant to NO x and SO 2 we can eliminate separate control steps and sequester the NO x and SO 2 along with the CO 2 resulting in a zero emissions power plant.

Therefore coal normally continues to emit gas even after it has been mined although more slowly than during the coal breakage stage. • Low temperature oxidation - These emissions arise because once coal is exposed to oxygen in air the coal oxidizes to produce CO2. However the rate of formation of CO2 by this process is low.
