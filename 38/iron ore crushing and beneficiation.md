Iron ore sample found is a part of banded iron ore formation. Hematite and goethite are major constituents of iron ore samples. Hematite in the ore sample occurs as specularite with inter granular micro-pore spaces. Goethite is profuse and occurs as colloform product in cavities in addition with the weaker bedding planes.
