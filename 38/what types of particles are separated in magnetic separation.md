## Separation of Mixtures Using Different Techniques (Theory 
Sometimes the solid particles in a liquid are very small and can pass through a filter paper. For such particles the filtration technique cannot be used for separation. Such mixtures are separated by centrifugation. So centrifugation is the process of separation of insoluble materials from a liquid where normal filtration does not work well.

## Magnetic Separation: The Basics 
 · Magnetic separation is the process of separating magnetic materials from non-magnetic materials using a magnetic system. After World War II this process became popular in scrap yards to separate metal particles from vehicles; however the process is more sophistied than that.

## Separation Techniques 
Magnetic Separation. Magnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet. Magnetism is ideal for separating mixtures of two solids with one part having magnetic properties.
