## Calculating the true savings when reducing air system pressure
 · The energy savings associated with network pressure results from a decrease in demand but will only be realized if the compressors reduce power as result of the demand change. The portion of system compressed air demand that is associated with operating at a higher than necessary pressure is referred to as artificial demand.

Mobile hydraulic systems are developed toward better control performance and higher energy efficiency. Pressure compensators which govern the pressure drops over the control orifices are widely used in multiactuator systems to improve their operability. However additional energy is also dissipated in the compensators especially under the overrunning load conditions.
