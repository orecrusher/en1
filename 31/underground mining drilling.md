Blast holes are thus a fundamental step in the exploratory mining process and can be employed in both surface mining operations and underground mining operations to varying degrees with varying

## How Underground Mining Works 
Underground mines are the alternative to surface mines. Surface mines excavate from the top down a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper -- uranium mines can reach 6500 feet or 2 kilometers.

## Underground Mining Safety 
We know dust and noise are pervasive safety hazards underground and if they aren't controlled can result in worker injury lost production and government fines. So we developed underground mining bits that produce less dust and designed underground drill bits that make less noise. Because nothing is more important than miner safety.
