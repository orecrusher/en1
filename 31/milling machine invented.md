## CNC Machines and CNC Milling Machines 
A portal milling machine is a cutter whose milling head is guided on a connecting member between two posts. The frame produced in this way resembles a portal hence the term portal milling machine. In industry portal milling machines are usually used for machining large surfaces for example when face milling large panels.

## Different Types of Machining Operations and the Machining 
 · Traditional milling machines feature moveable tables on which the workpieces are mounted. On these machines the cutting tools are stationary and the table moves the material so that the desired cuts can be made. Other types of milling machines feature both table and cutting tools as moveable implements.

## The History and Design of Milling Machines
 · In 1861 Brown Sharpe created the groundbreaking Universal Milling Machine which could mill complex part geometries with movement in three axes. From there production took off as WWI approached. Milling technology developed rapidly for the next few decades and the introduction of high-accuracy machines like the Jig Bore set the standard for milling accuracy.

## Machining Processes: Turning Milling and Drilling 
In machining several operations occur in a planned sequence to achieve the best results. We cover three of the most common operations including turning drilling and milling. Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods.

## Understanding the Process of 5
 · Understanding the Process of 5-Axis Machining. Many of you might have had some experience with 5-axis machining but for those new to the technology let's break it down. A machine that is capable of 5-axis design can move the toolpath in the X Y and Z directions as well as rotate in the A and B (or C) axes – thus the term 5-axis machining.

## History of the milling machine 
 · "A bit later in the year 1818 Eli Whitney (inventor of the cotton gin) invents a milling machine in New Haven Connecticut. Prior to the milling machine a machinist's tools were primarily files and required a highly skilled operator. The milling machine allowed a less skilled operator to make the same quality of parts as the skilled operator with the file.

## Milling Machine; The History 
In 1867 American engineer Joseph R. Brown () introduced his universal milling machine at the Paris Exhibition. Brown's machine arose following the testing in 1861 of one designed to solve the problem of producing spiral flutes for twist drills. This machine proved amazingly versatile and led to Brown's significant addition in 1864 of a formed cutter.
