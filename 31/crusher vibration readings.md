The "RMS" value is calculated by simply multiplying the peak amplitude (shown in the graphic below) by 0.707: RMS = Peak x 0.707. But is that technically correct ? Technically the RMS value of a pure sinusoid is equal to the area under the half-wave.

## Measuring Vibration with Accelerometers 
 · Vibration is most commonly measured using a ceramic piezoelectric sensor or accelerometer. An accelerometer is a sensor that measures the dynamic acceleration of a physical device as a voltage. Accelerometers are full-contact transducers typically mounted directly on high-frequency elements such as rolling-element bearings gearboxes or spinning blades.

## Vibration Due To Shaft Misalignment 
 · Take several phase readings at each point to ensure accurate phase data that may vary due to speed changes. Vibration IndiionsWhen axial vibration at 1× or 2× is 50 percent or more of radial vibration suspect misalignment. Be careful here because shaft misalignment isn't the only problem that can cause high axial vibration.
