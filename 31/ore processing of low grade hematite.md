## Hematite 
Hematite (/ ˈ h iː m ə ˌ t aɪ t ˈ h ɛ m ə-/) also spelled as haematite is a common iron oxide compound with the formula Fe 2 O 3 and is widely found in rocks and soils. Hematite crystals belong to the rhombohedral lattice system which is designated the alpha polymorph of Fe 2 O 3.It has the same crystal structure as corundum (Al 2 O 3) and ilmenite (FeTiO 3).

## Hematite and Itabirite 
Hematite has traditionally formed the bulk of global iron ore production and high-grade hematite is often referred to as "Direct Shipping Ore" or "DSO" because it is mined and beneficiated using a relatively simple crushing and screening process before being exported for use in steel mills.

## Eco
 · The majority of steel production is supported by iron ore sourced from high-grade hematite deposits although a significant fraction comes from magnetite deposits. Compared to direct shipping hematite ores mined from the upper regolith magnetite deposits require significant beneficiation which typically involves grinding to a particle size where magnetite is liberated from its silie matrix.
