 · The major factors affecting ilmenite microwave‐pretreatment flotation are microwave power level and irradiation time. The investigation into the surface zeta potential indies that microwave irradiation enhanced the adsorption of oleate ions in the Helmholtz layer of the ilmenite particles and resulted in ilmenite surface charge being more negative.

## Effect of microwave radiation on ilmenite flotation 
The specific surface area of ilmenite samples underwent a significant change with microwave exposure time; also new phases were observed. Microwave exposure speeded up the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric ions on the ilmenite surface. This resulted in an enhancement of oleate ion adsorption and therefore improved ilmenite flotation behaviour.

 · In this study the surface chemistry of monazite in terms of zeta potential adsorption density and flotation responses using octanohydroxamic acid is determined. Apatite ilmenite quartz rutile and zircon are the minerals that frequently occur with monazite and hence they were chosen as gangue minerals in this study.

Ilmenite flotation is often used in flotation of ilmenite. At present there are many researches on ilmenite flotation reagents but the main content of them is the selection of collectors. The commonly used collectors for ilmenite are fatty acids and foreign oil acids and their salts such as tar soaps or collectors are mixed with kerosene.
