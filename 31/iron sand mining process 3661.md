This process uses suction dredging in groundwater to extract iron sands for separation prior to exporting. This sand can then be used for construction concrete and to replenish beaches. In New Zealand the Taharoa iron sand mining project extracts sand from a pond by a floating dredge which is then conveyed to an adjacent floating concentration plant for processing.
