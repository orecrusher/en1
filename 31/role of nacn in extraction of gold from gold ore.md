Extraction of gold using cyanide Gold is found in very low concentrations in the ore from which it is mined. To collect the gold from the ore it needs to be separated from the other minerals in the ore. To do this the gold needs to be made into a soluble form so that it can be separated from the other minerals as gold is insoluble.

## Role of NaCN in the extraction 
NaCN in the extraction of gold from gold ore: In the metallurgy of gold gold metal is leached with a dilute solution of NaCN in the presence of air (for O2). The gold metal is then obtained from the product by displacement reaction. In the extraction of gold and silver the metal is leached with NaCN or KCN which is an oxidation reaction.
