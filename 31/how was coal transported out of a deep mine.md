This plant which processes coal from one underground mine includes a deep mine coal stockpile area a truck loading haulage road and a coal train loading point. The raw coal from the underground mine is transported to the surface by a 5 foot belt conveyor and then deposited into two raw coal silos; one of which is of 5000 ton capacity and the other a 1500 ton capacity.

The coal is mined (most of the coal mines in the Hunter Valley are open cut mines also known as open pit mines) processed blended and stored either at a railway siding loed at the mine or at a coal loading facility (used by several mines). The coal is then transported to the Port of Newcastle almost exclusively by rail.
