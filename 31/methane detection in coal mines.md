## How To Detect Poisonous And Harmful Gas In Coal Mine?
2.Detection of methane CH4 in coal mine. In coal mine accidents fire caused by gas explosion and gas combustion accounts for a large proportion and they often occur together. The main cause of gas explosion is the accumulation of gas in the mine. The main component of gas is methane (CH4) accounting for 83-89%.

## Frequent Questions About Coal Mine Methane 
In 2015 U.S. coal mines recovered and utilized more than 33 billion cubic feet of coal mine methane (CMM). Nearly all of this gas was sold to natural gas pipelines. Globally as of 2015 there are more than 200 operating recovery and utilization projects in about 15 countries at active or abandoned coal mines and approximately 30 more projects in development.
