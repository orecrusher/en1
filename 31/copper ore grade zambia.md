Ball mills grind the crushed ore for subsequent flotation to produce a copper concentrate grade of approximately 30%. At Nkana the cobalt floats with the copper and then has to be separated out by a differential float using lime to alter the pH and sodium cyanide; this is not an exact process and as a result some of the copper remains within the cobalt stream which is recycled in the process

 · The head grade equaled or fell short of ore grades in just under 32% of mines in 2000 and in 14% of mines head grades were at least double the ore reserve grades. By 2008 the share of mines whose head grades were at least double their ore grades had fallen to almost 10% and the mines whose head grades were the same as or less than their ore grades had risen to 50% of the total.
