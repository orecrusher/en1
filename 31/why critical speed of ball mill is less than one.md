## Critical speed 
Critical speed depends upon the magnitude and loion of the shaft unbalance the length of the shaft its diameter and the kind of bearing support. Many practical appliions suggest as good practice that the maximum operating speed should not exceed 75% of the critical speed; however there are cases that require speeds above the critical speed to work correctly.

Use the Right Feeds and Speeds. It's absolutely critical to have the right feeds and speeds for finishing work–no guessing! Reducing length to diameter ratio by 25% makes the tool more than twice as stiff so it deflects less than half as much. The biggest challenge with ball nosed end mills of various kinds is slow nose speed.

 · Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed the overall removal is quite brisk.

While these speeds are fine for small router bits using larger bits say more than 1-inch (25 mm) or 25 millimeters in diameter can be dangerous and can lead to chatter. Larger routers now have variable speeds and larger bits require slower speed. Drilling wood generally uses higher spindle speeds than metal and the speed is not as critical.

## Air Resistance Drag Force and Velocity: How Falling Works
 · Q: Why does air resistance slow things down? With air resistance acceleration throughout a fall gets less than gravity (g) because air resistance affects the movement of the falling object by slowing it down.How much it slows the object down depends on the surface area of the object and its speed. Usually resistance is not very high at low speed or for small or sharp objects.

Choosing the tool that allows the completion of a project with the least deflection and highest productivity is critical. As the ADOC needed to slot can be lower a stub length of cut is often the strongest and most appropriate tool choice.

The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size - mills including a roller press are mostly single-chambered) allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media.
