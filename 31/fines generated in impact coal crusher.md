## Numerical Simulation Study of Fines Migration Impacts on 
Coal fines migration exerts negative impacts on early water drainage of undersaturated coal seam gas (CSG) reservoirs. The complied migration process results in ineffective and inaccurate forecast of coal fines production. Hence a robust modelling tool is required to include the mechanisms of fines migration and to predict their impacts on rock and production.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks gravel sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size or change the form of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore) so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Aggregate production: Fines generation during rock crushing
The generation of fines increases when shear is imposed during crushing. Aggregates produced in current crushing operations show the effects of multiple loading conditions and fracture modes. Results support the producers' empirical observations that the desired cubicity of aggregates is obtained at the expense of increased fines generation when standard equipment is used.
