 · Besides release of metals mining operations is also responsible for the release of methane (CH 4) gas. CH 4 is formed in coal during the process of coalifiion and the quality and quantity of the gas created and retained is a function of the original organic matter composition and the conditions of burial.

## Coal mining 
Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%. Techniques have been developed to eliminate and/or dilute methane emissions both prior to and during mining and this has helped to significantly reduce methane related explosions in underground mines.

## Mine Accidents and Disasters 
104 Deaths due to a mining accident were reported at the Vaal Reefs Number Two Shaft near Orkney North West on 10 May 1995. An underground locomotive fell down a shaft and landed onto a cage loaded with night shift mine workers coming to surface. This was arguably one of the worst accidents in the mining industry in South Africa.
