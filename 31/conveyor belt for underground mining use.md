## Underground safety of conveyor belts
Conveyor belts represent a high risk because they have the ability to spread a fire over long distances. Fires on belt conveyors are mostly ignited by mechanical failures like frozen idlers which is even more dangerous in combination with coal dust. The fire safety requirements are similar for the most hard coal mining countries.
