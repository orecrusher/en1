The Great Dyke Zimbabwe contains over 800 million ounces of platinum and approximately 20 million ounces of rhodium. However about 10% of the ore is oxidized and cannot be processed with current recovery methods. A conventional flotation-smelting process has been proposed to recover the platinum group metal (PGM) values from the sulfide ores.
