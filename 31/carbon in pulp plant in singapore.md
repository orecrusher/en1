The most well known carbon-in-pulp plant remains the prototype Homestake plant in Lead South Dakota. Operating since 1973 this facility treats 2130 tonnes of ore per day averaging 2.7 g gold per tonne. Homestake has also operated small silver carbon-in-pulp plants at Creede and Cripple Creek Colorado since 1979.

The efficient design of carbon-in-pulp (C.I.P.) plants involves the integration of both process engineering and design engineering. Many recently constructed plants have not recognised the above interrelationship and as such have incurred higher capital and operating costs than were in reality necessary. This has been compounded in some cases by slavishly following the design of plants
