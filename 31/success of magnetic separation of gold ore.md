## How to Extract Separate Refine Gold 
 · Separate the gold from unwanted rocks and minerals using one of several methods. You can mix the gold ore with sodium cyanide which will attach itself to the gold and separate other elements such as zinc. Or pan the gold manually in water to separate gold from the gravel and sand in a stream. Refine the gold you have extracted and separated.

## What is Electrostatic Separation? (with pictures)
In a similar way to that in which electrostatic separation sorts particles with different electrostatic charges magnetic beneficiation sorts particles that respond to a magnetic field. Electrostatic beneficiation is effective for removing particulate matter such as ash from mined coal while magnetic separation functions well for removing the magnetic iron ore from deposits of clay in the earth.
