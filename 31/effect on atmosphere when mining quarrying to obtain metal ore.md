## Mining 
Iron Ore []. Iron ore is necessary to forge iron ingots which are required to make all the metal resources in the game. From swords to nails. To mine it from any of its sources you will need a pickaxe. The quality of the pickaxe has a considerable impact on the amount of energy necessary and the speed at which you will mine it has no effect on the amount of ore dropped.

## Mineral Deposit Value 
Therefore you could see a major or mid-tier mining company that wants to replace their mined reserves just pay a small percentage of this metal value for the deposit (i.e. 5% to 10%). To find out how much of this mineral deposit value I assign to the mining company's value as a whole I recommend you to read the second note at the bottom of this page.

## Environmental impact of mining in the rainforest
 · The impact of mining in the rainforest. Mining exposes previously buried metal sulfides to atmospheric oxygen causing their conversion to strong sulfuric acid and metal oxides which run off into local waterways. Oxides tend to more soluble in water and contaminate local rivers with heavy metals.

 · There will also be an enormous complex to extract lithium from the mined ore for its conversion into a non-volatile carbonate form to be made into batteries. Because lithium's concentration in ore at Thacker Pass runs as low as two-tenths of one percent producing one ton of the stuff for use by society entails strip mining and processing as much as 500 tons of earth.
