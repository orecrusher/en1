It was also found that pretreatment only in highly alkaline media (pH > 13) can be effective in gold recovery. Gold and silver extractions during subsequent cyanidation were improved from 69.4 to 80.7% for gold and 44.4 to 88.9% for silver where the extraction yields of arsenic iron and zinc were 93.7 75.9 and 26.9% respectively.

The recovery of gold via a gravity circuit is a beneficial and economical process to all operating plants. However the efficiency in this circuit is an important factor to consider. The intensive cyanidation process for treating gravity concentrates is becoming more favourable in the gold processing industry today. The cyanidation process is an efficient means of obtaining high gold recoveries

Very high gold grades in solution - above 4000ppm. It is possible to precipitate sodiumaurocyanide as a salt - NaAu (CN)2 at high levels of gold and sodium in solution. This is made worse by high cyanide and caustic levels. The remedy is to increase the solution volume and/or reduce the caustic addition.

The Intensive Cyanidation Of Goldplant Gravity Concentrates. Final table tailings with a gold concentration of 10to 12 gft were obtained. The results of the investigation strongly suggested that an alternative cyanidation route for the treatment of gold-plant concentrates was technically feasible provided the system included effective agitation and oxygenation.
