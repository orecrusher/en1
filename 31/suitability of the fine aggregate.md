Fine aggregate is the essential ingredient in concrete that consists of natural sand or crushed stone. The quality and fine aggregate density strongly influence the hardened properties of the concrete.. The concrete or mortar mixture can be made more durable stronger and cheaper if you made the selection of fine aggregate on basis of grading zone particle shape and surface texture abrasion
