## Investigation of the use of Ishiagu Galena Concrete in E
Galena is a mineral of about 86.6% lead and 13.4% of Sulphur. Therefore it is one of the most widely distributed of all sulphides and constitutes the most important ore for lead [4]. The average hardness of galena is about 2.85 on mineralogy scale and it has a specific gravity in the range of 7400 -7600 kgm-3.
