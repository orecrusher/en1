## Vertimill® 
In fact in the same appliion a Vertimill® has 50% less footprint than a ball mill. Lower operating cost. Vertimill® is an energy efficient grinding machine. They tend to grind more efficiently than for example ball mills with feeds as coarse as 6 mm to products finer than 20 microns. This provides up to a 40% higher energy efficiency.

## Ball Mill Used in Minerals Processing Plant 
This ball mill is typically designed to grind mineral ores and other materials with different hardness and it is widely used in different fields such as ore dressing building material field chemical industry etc. Due to the difference of its slurry discharging method it is divided to two types: grid type ball mill and overflow type ball mill.

## What Is a Milling Machine Used for? 
 · Milling machines come in sizes ranging from small to those requiring warehouse space to operate. Using a wide range of tools milling machines carve and drill into raw products to create shapes and nearly finished products. They can drill holes add threads for bolts or make precise shapes out of any solid material.

Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
