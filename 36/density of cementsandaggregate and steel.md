## Concrete Density 
EN 206:2013+A1:2016 (2016) defines heavyweight concrete as having an oven dry density greater than 2600 kg/m 3. The density achieved will depend on the type of aggregate used. High-density aggregates generally consist of high-density minerals or rocks or they are man-made materials such as steel

## Why Is Density Important? 
 · Measuring density is very important for many different industries because the density measurement will help determine the characteristics of a material for example whether the material will float or sink. Knowing the density of a material helps in determining the mass and volume of a material all of which are extremely important measurements

 · The density of concrete may seem rather an out-of-the-way subject to the readership of NSC but it is one which matters to us. Most steel structures composite or not are burdened with concrete in one form or another. There is a move afoot to talk up the density (or if preferred unit weight) assumed for concrete in structural design.

## hodic Current Density 
Current density is CP current per square meter. The initial and final design current densities give a measure of the anticipated hodic current density demand to achieve CP of a bare metal surface within a reasonably short period of time. The mean design current density is a measure of the anticipated hodic current density once the CP system has attained its steady-state protection potential.
