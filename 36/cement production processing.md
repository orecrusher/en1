## The Cement Industry
Co-processing is the term used to describe introducing alternative fuels and raw materials into a standard cement production process rather than using conventional fuels and raw materials. A cement kiln producing clinker (the main constituent of cement) is by its nature an efficient tool for the recovery of minerals and energy from waste

## Cement production and cooling 
 · Cement is the combination of calcium carbonate silica alumina and ferrous oxide which are naturally found in limestone rock chalk shale and/or clay. During the cement production process these minerals are fused together by heating them to just under their melting point forming a cement clinker between 3 to 20 mm in diameter.

The total consumption of coal in this method is only about 100 kg when compared to the requirement of about 220 kg for producing a ton of cement in the wet process. The dry material undergoes a series of chemical reactions in the hottest part of the kiln and some 20 to 30 percent of the material becomes liquid and lime silica and alumina recombine.

## Cement Production Process 
Cement Production Process Clinker and cement production is an intensive process in terms of natural raw material and energy input. Limestone (primary source of calcium carbonate CaCO 3 ) and clay (primary source of silica SiO 2 alumina Al 2 O 3 and iron oxide Fe 2 O 3 ) are typically mined in company-owned quarries and pre-blended to a target chemical material composition.
