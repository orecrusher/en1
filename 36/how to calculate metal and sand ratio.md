 · To make ease in understanding we are finding the Concrete mix design of M20 grade concrete. The Concrete mix ratio for M20 grade of concrete is 1:1.5:3 that mean 1 part of cement 1.5 part of sand (fine aggregate) and 3 parts of aggregate (crushed stone) in volume and then batched for mixing. To know the Concrete Mix Design follow below:-.

If the typical sand-to-metal ratio is 5 and the binder content is 125 then the typical binder level is 1.25%. It seems that we use a lot of sand by volume. Sand is about 1/5 the density of steel so a 5:1 sand-to-metal ratio means 25 volumes of sand for each casting volume shipped or at 50% yield more than ten volumes of sand to steel poured.

## How to Determine the Relative Density of Soils
Two sands having same relative density would show similar behavior under loads although their void ratios may be different. Relative Density in Terms of Density : To determine the relative density it is necessary to determine the specific gravity of soils in order to calculate the void ratio from dry density in the loosest in-situ and densest states.

The formula then is to multiply the three together: width x height x length and then multiply by the density to get to the weight. For example for an aluminum rectangular bar with a cross section of 20 mm by 30 mm and a length of 2 meters we need to calculate the volume as 20 x 30 x 2000 = cubic millimeters or 1200 cubic centimeters.
