Run-of-Mine (ROM) ore is crushed and ground in semi-autogenous (SAG) and ball mills free gold is recovered in a gravity circuit and flotation is used to recover a sulphide concentrate. This is then oxidized using autoclaves producing feed for conventional carbon-in-leach (CIL) cyanide leaching to recover the contained gold.

Open pit mining where material is excavated from an open pit is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals. This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.

## Processes 
Mining The ore is removed from the ground in either open pit or underground mines. Underground – sinking a vertical shaft into the earth to reach the copper ore and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore. Open-pit – 90% of ore is mined using the open pit method. Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers. The ore

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The

Ore is removed from the crust by mining either on the surface (open pit mining) or underground (shaft mining or room and pillar mining). Some minerals can be used in their natural form for example sand in the building industry phosphate rock for fertilisers and diamonds in jewellery.

## Surface mining – strip open pit mountaintop removal 
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining in which the overlying rock is left behind and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface

## What is Gold Ore worth? High Grade Mining Ore
Ore is defined as "a naturally occurring mineral containing a valuable constituent (as metal) for which it is mined and worked". In other word ore is the most basic raw form of a mineral which requires additional processing for the valuable minerals (gold) to be removed. A single piece of gold ore generally has very little actual gold

## How Gold Is Refined: A Step
Reclaiming the Mine; No gold mine lasts forever. No one can predict how long any mine will last because it's different for each one. But usually after a few years the gold in the mine is exhausted. In the past this exhausted mine would just be abandoned and left to nature. Today however we begin a reclamation process of the empty mine.

Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals. The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade like copper gold and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper an excellent conductor of electricity is used as electrical wire.Copper is also used in construction.
