## ore mineral processing methods introduction
Mineral processing or mineral beneficiation or upgradation involves handling of three primary types of ROM ore material which has been blasted fragmented and brought out from in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.
