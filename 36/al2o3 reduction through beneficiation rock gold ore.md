## Copper Ore 
During beneficiation of clay-containing copper-gold ores the use of small quantities of Na 2 S (at natural pH) improves both copper and gold metallurgy considerably. In the presence of soluble ions (e.g. Fe Cu) additions of small quantities of organic acid (e.g. oxalic tartaric) improve gold recovery in the copper concentrate.
