## Analysis of the Single Toggle Jaw Crusher Force 
This paper sets out to perform a static force analysis of the single toggle jaw crusher mechanism and to obtain the force transmission characteristics of the mechanism. In order to obtain force transmission metrics that are characteristic of the structure of the mechanism such influences as friction dead weight and inertia are considered to be extraneous and neglected.
