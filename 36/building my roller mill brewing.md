The 3-roller mill has several advantages and few disadvantages. It has greater output than a 2-roller model running at the same RPM. It provides less husk damage which aids in sparging. Also the 3-roller mill more fully separates the starch from the husk while providing superior grain feed even with wheat.

The gap settings were 1.25 mm 1.0 mm 0.75 mm and 0.50 mm and I used a feeler gauge to confirm these gap setting between each milling. After milling I performed a grain sieve test on the different malts and crushes and recorded all of the results.
