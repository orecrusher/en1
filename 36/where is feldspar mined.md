## What is Feldspar? (with pictures) 
Many feldspars are igneous meaning they were formed from magma. The distinguishing feature of minerals in the feldspar group is that they are comprised of silies of aluminum blended with other metals like potassium calcium sodium and sometimes barium.The composition of an individual piece determines its chemical properties and what color it will be but it shares similarities with other

## Sunstone 
Sunstone is also known as "heliolite" and more commonly "aventurescent feldspar." It is cut into cabochons beads and small sculptures. The most transparent pieces are used to produce faceted stones. Sunstone is popular with innovative jewelry designers and is especially popular in the geographic areas where it is commercially mined.
