Cadmium and Zn adsorption diminished somewhat when Ca was present at higher Zn and Cd loadings but competition from Ca was minimal at low metal loadings. It is proposed that the high energy binding is an exchange sorption on the negatively charged oxide sites by displacement of surface and diffuse layer ions and protons which binds Cd more strongly than Zn.

## Kinetic and isotherm studies of cadmium adsorption on 
The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics studies of cadmium (Cd) ions from aqueous solutions on manganese nodule residue were carried out by considering the influence of various parameters such as contact time solution pH and initial metal concentration in solution temperature and adsorbent quantity. The adsorption of Cd increased with an increase in the concentrations of this metal in solution.

## Removal of Aquatic Cadmium Ions Using Thiourea Modified 
Removal of aquatic cadmium ions using biochar is a low-cost method but the results are usually not satisfactory. Modified biochar which can be a low-cost and efficient material is urgently required for Cd-polluted water and soil remediation. Herein poplar bark (SB) and poplar sawdust (MB) were used as raw materials to prepare modified biochar which is rich in N- and S- containing groups

 · The adsorption of Cd(II) on Mn oxide as function of adsorption time pH ionic strength temperature and initial Cd(II) concentration was investigated by batch techniques. The adsorption kinetics showed that the adsorption of Cd(II) on Mn oxide can be satisfactorily simulated by pseudo-second-order kinetic model with high correlation coefficients (R 2 > 0.999).

## Adsorption of Cd(II) from aqueous solutions by rape straw 
The adsorption sites created by the loaded manganese oxide rather than specific surface areas play the most important roles in cadmium adsorption. Batch adsorption experiments demonstrate a Langmuir model fit for Cd(II) and BC-MnO x provided the highest sorption capacity (81.10 mg g-1).

 · The influence of these components on cadmium adsorption was also examined. Results showed that Langmuir equation could accurately describe the adsorption characteristics of Cd in bulk soil and aggregates. The <0.002 mm fraction had the largest adsorption capacity for Cd because of its higher content of organic matter and Fe and Mn oxides.
