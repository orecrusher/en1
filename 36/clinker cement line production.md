## Reducing CO2 through clinker replacement 
 · The impact on strength can be mitigated by increased clinker quality increased cement fineness or through the appropriate appliion of a chemical additive such as a quality improver. It is common for cement performance additives to achieve a strength gain of between 2 - 8MPa and with such an increase it is possible to lower the clinker factor by 3-10%.

the modern cement industry has become more conscious of the energy e ciency of the whole production line while pursuing increased capacities of cement kilns. It is estimated that 95% of the energy consumption in cement clinker production comes from thermal energy; fuel consumption accounts for 50–60% of the total costs of cement production [7].

## Cement – Analysis 
Clinker is the main ingredient in cement and the amount used is directly proportional to the CO 2 emissions generated in cement manufacturing due to both the combustion of fuels and the decomposition of limestone in the clinker production process.. From 2014 to 2018 the clinker-to-cement ratio increased at an average of 1.6% per year reaching an estimated 0.70 in 2018; this rise

## What is Cement Clinker? Composition Types Uses 
Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products. The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3-25 mm and dark grey in color. It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400°C-1500°C in the rotary kiln.
