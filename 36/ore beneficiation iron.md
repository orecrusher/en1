## Iron Ore Beneficiation 
Iron ores come in come in many shapes and sizes (and mineralogies) so there is no one size fits all approach to beneficiation. For magnetite ores it is typically necessary to liberate the individual magnetite grains from the host rocks after which beneficiation is relatively straightforward due to the magnetic properties of magnetite.

## Iron Ore Analysis Process Optimization Solutions 
Decreasing ore grades of existing or new iron ore deposits require predictive solutions to efficiently sort and blend iron ore for optimal and profitable beneficiation and downstream processing. Elemental and mineralogical composition as well as predictive models for the upgradability based on metallurgical parameters such as washable constituents play an important role for iron ore producers.

## Iron ore and its beneficiation: 
 · Iron ore and its beneficiation: Most useful metal in the world Iron is extracted from iron ore. It is the rock from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. Iron ore is a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). The iron ore usually very rich in iron oxides (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3).
