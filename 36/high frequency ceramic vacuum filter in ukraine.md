## An Introduction to Filters 
 · Active filters can be used to design high-order filters without the use of inductors; this is important because inductors are problematic in the context of integrated-circuit manufacturing techniques. However active filters are less suitable for very-high-frequency appliions because of amplifier bandwidth limitations.

High pass filter: The high pass filter is in many ways the inverse of the low pass filter. It only allows signals through that are higher than the cut-off frequency. Above this point it is nominally flat and below the RF filter cut-off frequency the response falls away at a rate determined by the order of the filter.
