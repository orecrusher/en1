## Ammonium nitrate: A fertiliser under scrutiny 
 · The world's annual production of ammonium nitrate is over 20 million tonnes for fertilisers alone which means the amount that exploded in Beirut (2700 tonnes) is made almost every hour. Storing hundreds or even thousands of tonnes in the same place is frequent and a single farmer can easily use several tonnes a year.

Loss of ammonium nitrate to drain from a large number of sources is a potential prob- lem for all ammonium nitrate plants. A common cause is the losses from pump seals but losses can be simply leaks from flanges passing valves etc. or they may be deliberate washings of process equipment because of build-up in solids handling equipment or the preparation of equipment for maintenance.

Ammonium Nitrate fertilizer is used by a lot of farmers because of its nitrogen content. But the most important thing to consider about the correlation between plants and nitrogen is the absorption. Although nitrogen is naturally found in the soil and the earth's atmosphere the form at which nitrogen is absorbed by the plant is very specific.

Production of ammonium nitrate is the largest single end use for nitric acid and has ranked 10th to 12th in volume of all inorganic chemicals produced in both Canada and the Unites States over the last 20 years (Table 11.10).This interest has been stimulated by the demand for ammonium nitrate as a fertilizer component and as an ingredient in explosives.

## What happens when ammonia reacts with nitric acid?
 · The industrial production of ammonium nitrate entails the acid-base reaction of ammonia with nitric acid: HNO3 + NH3 → NH4NO. Ammonia is used in its anhydrous form (i.e. gas form) and the nitric acid is concentrated. Ammonia produced by the Haber process is oxidized to nitric acid by the Ostwald process.
