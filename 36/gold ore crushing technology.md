## 3 Technologies in Exploration Mining and Processing 
 · Technologies that could fracture and rubblize ore in such a way that fluids would preferentially flow through the orebody and dissolve ore-bearing minerals (although this would be difficult in competent rocks with high compressive strengths) are therefore a high priority need for in-situ mining.
