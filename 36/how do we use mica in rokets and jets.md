## Frequently Asked Questions About Quasars
We now think these objects are the very bright centers of some distant galaxies where some sort of energetic action is occurring most probably due to the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of that galaxy (supermassive = made up from a mass of about a billion solar masses). What do quasars have to do with black holes?

## Car paint types explained – what are solid metallic 
 · Metallic finishes. Metallic paints reflect light for a much brighter shine than solids. They come in a wider variety of colours and add relatively little to the cost of the car – from around £500 on small cars. The shine comes from a small amount of aluminium powder mixed into the paint. The metal particles pick up and reflect light hence

## How do space rockets work? 
 · As we've already seen rockets differ from jet planes (and other fuel-powered vehicles that work on Earth) because they have to carry their own oxygen supply. Modern space rockets have main engines powered by a liquid fuel (such as liquid hydrogen) and liquid oxygen (which does the same job as the air sucked into a car engine) that are pumped in from huge tanks.

 · Use your digital multimeter (DMM) to ensure all power to the circuit is OFF. If the capacitor is used in an ac circuit set the multimeter to measure ac voltage. If is used in a dc circuit set the DMM to measure dc voltage. Visually inspect the capacitor. If leaks cracks bulges or other signs of deterioration are evident replace the capacitor.

We used that grease without incident for many years in hundreds of thousands of connectors completely flooding F connectors that were directly exposed to snow or rain. I continue to use silicone dielectric grease today. I use it as a lubricant on coaxial connector O-rings and threads. I use it to lube stainless bolts and nuts to prevent galling.
