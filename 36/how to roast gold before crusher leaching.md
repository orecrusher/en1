## Gold Recovery And How To Choose The Right Process 
Gold deposits can be grouped into two primary classes: placer deposits where the gold is exposed from weathering and erosion and hard rock where the gold is still trapped within the host rock. Gold recovery methods for these two types of deposits vary greatly from simple panning to a complex network of grinding chemical leaching gravity concentration and more.

## 4 Reasons and Solutions of Poor Gold Leaching Effect
 · If the gold ore is still difficult to be successfully leached after being finely ground the gold ore is called refractory gold. Generally the grade of Au in the tailings is greater than 0.5g/t. The gold in this type of ore either physically wrapped or chemically combined cannot be in contact with the cyanide solution so it is difficult to be leached.

## How to Improve the Refractory Gold Leaching Process? 
 · 01 One. Pretreat the refractory gold. The gold leaching rate of most refractory gold ores is about 10% ~ 20% when they are directly stirred by sodium cyanide. Generally the gold leaching rate of refractory gold ore can be greatly improved by pretreating the raw materials including oxidative roasting hot-pressure oxidation biological oxidation.
