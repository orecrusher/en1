## Block caving mining method with Elfen software explained 
Block caving is a mining method that relies upon natural forces to break the rock. The cave is initiated by an undercut where a large area beneath the mining block is removed; gravity induced stresses then develop within the rock causing it to fracture. The fracturing process is progressive and affects the entire rock mass overlying the undercut.

Block caving is an inexpensive bulk mining method where the ore is drawn by gravity and which is suitable for ore bodies which are low grade and are consistent in their grades. Depending on how the ore is broken there are three block caving systems 1) The Grizzly system for fine material 2) the slusher system for coarser material and 3) the LHD system for very coarse material.

Â Â· 1. Introduction. Block caving is a method that is completely based on the principles of caving. This method is based on the assumption that ore fractures and breaks by itself due to the presence of internal stresses and forces caused by the weight of the ore body and also the downward movement of the broken rocks. 1 The deposit is divided into large blocks usually square in shape.

These include block caving panel caving and its variations. These methods currently have the lowest operational costs and highest productivity in underground mining [1].

However in combined surface and underground mining the breakthrough of an underground caving under an open pit may result in subsidence at the bottom of the pit. This can pose a serious threat for the stability of the pit and the safety of the mining. In order to

Â Â· As compared to other mining methods sublevel caving allows for a quicker and less expensive mining process. However sublevel caving leads to greater dilution and is therefore used for lower ore bodies. The costs for sublevel caving range from $5-8$/tonne. Block Caving. Block caving is the logical step-up of sublevel caving.

Caving methods. Caving methods include block caving sublevel caving and longwall mining.For emphasis allow me to repeat what I said earlier: caving methods are used in settings where the ore or the host rock is so weak that it cannot support its own weight for any period of time; the methods only work if the rock or the ore will readily cave under its own weight.

Block caving is a large-scale mining method that is particularly useful for mining low-grade or disseminated ore bodies which are at too great a depth to be exploited through open-cast mining. This mining technique gets its name from the layout of the mine which divides the ore into large sections or 'blocks'.
