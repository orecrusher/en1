iron and the second is that of actual steel manufacture. The details of these steps are outlined below. Step 1 - The production of molten iron The Primary Concentrate is mixed with limestone and coal and heated. The iron oxides are reduced in the solid state to metallic iron which then melts and the impurities are removed either as slag or gas.
