## Iron ore mining and dressing 
 · Regions in which iron ore has formed over millions of years (e.g. through volcanism) and can be mined economically are also referred to as iron ore deposits. Especially many ore deposits can be found in countries such as China Australia Brazil India and Russia. These countries account for around 85 % of the total global iron ore mining volume.

## Iron Ore Mining 
 · MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? 
 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
