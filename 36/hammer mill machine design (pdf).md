As a source of abundant natural resources crop straws need to be crushed before utilization. The hammer mill is widely used in the processing areas of the straw and feed. Using SolidWorks software into modeling of the hammer mill is to break the traditional two-dimensional method of design. Thus it clearly reflects the structure of the parts and the movement of the assembly furthermore
