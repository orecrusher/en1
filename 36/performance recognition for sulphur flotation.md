## Performance Recognition for Sulphur Flotation Process 
As an important indior of flotation performance froth texture is believed to be related to operational condition in sulphur flotation process. A novel fault detection method based on froth texture unit distribution (TUD) is proposed to recognize the fault condition of sulphur flotation in real time.
