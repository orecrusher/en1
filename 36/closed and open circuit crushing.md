## Crusher 
Both open and closed circuit crushing are employed. For close circuit the product is screened with a mesh size much less than the set. Fig. 6.4 is a typical set up where ore crushed in primary and secondary crushers are further reduced in size by a rough roll crusher in open circuit followed by finer size reduction in a closed circuit by roll crusher.

## Open Circuit: What is it? (And How Does it Differ To a 
 · An open circuit is defined as an electric circuit in which current does not flow. Current can only flow in a circuit if it finds a continuous path—known as a "closed circuit". If there's a break anywhere in the circuit you have an open circuit and current can not flow. In an open circuit the two terminals are disconnected.

A Game of Efficiency: Open and Closed Circuit Crushing. However as open circuit layouts rarely return material for additional processing they can be valuable in achieving maximum efficiency. On the other hand closed circuit layouts like most portable crushing plants are an affordable alternative and comparatively compact.

## Open or Closed Circuit Crushing
 · Closed Circuit Reduction-Stage Capacities Thus far we have considered open-circuit crushing through the several reductions in a multi-stage crushing plant. Very rarely are we able to turn out a finished product without closing the flow-line circuit somewhere along the line. Without going into any argument for or against closed-circuit crushing in any of the various stages let us examine just what effect closing the circuit
