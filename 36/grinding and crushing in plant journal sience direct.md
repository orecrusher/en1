Sesame butter is widely consumed in Asian and Middle Eastern countries and can also be further processed for oil extraction. Roasting and grinding processes affect both the organoleptic properties and the processing characteristics of the butter. The effects of microwave-heating and roll-grinding on the sesame-milling properties and the paste texture of sesame butter are studied.
