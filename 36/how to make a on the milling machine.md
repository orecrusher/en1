## The History Of Cnc Machines 
This made possible to machine complex shapes required for aviation industry. With a manual milling machine it was never possible and that is how he developed the NC milling machine. (Olivo 1987) After most pioneering efforts by Parsons and MIT researchers the ball set rolling for further growth and development of NC/CNC in the later years to come.

 · A milling machine is a machine tool that removes metal as the work is fed against a rotating multipoint cutter. The milling cutter rotates at high speed and it removes metal at a very fast rate with the help of multiple cutting edges. One or more number of cutters can be mounted simultaneously on the milling machine.

Making the transition to 5-sided machining on a 5-axis CNC machine solves many of the problems so many shops face: finding qualified machinists (the skills gap); excessive setup costs due to inefficiency; and reacting to pressure from customers both pricing pressure and delivery pressure. To be blunt adding a 5th axis saves time and money.

## Vertical Machining
Vertical Machining also known as milling relies on rotary cutters to remove metal from a workpiece. Vertical machining occurs on a vertical machining center (VMC) which employs a spindle with a vertical orientation. With a vertically oriented spindle tools stick straight down from the tool holder and often cut across the top of a workpiece.

## A New Milling 101: Milling Forces 
 · Most peripheral milling cutters are made with helical teeth. Helical teeth enter the workpiece at a single point with impact progressively increasing across the width of the cut. If the width of the workpiece is a whole multiple of the axial pitch of the cutter a helical cutter can be designed to cut with practically uniform cutting force explaining their wide preference.

## Face milling 
Face milling with a very high feed per tooth (up to 4 mm/tooth) is possible when using cutters that have small entering angles or when using round insert cutters due to their chip thinning effect. Although the depth of cut is limited to less than 2.8 mm the extreme feed makes it a highly productive milling method.
