Crushed ore is directly fed to the grinding circuit from the crushed ore stockpile. The grinding circuit consists of a SAG mill and a Ball mill operating in a closed circuit with a battery of cyclones for classifiion. The cyclone battery consists of nine 80-inch Krebs cyclones with an apex opening of 4.25 inches and vortex opening of 6 inches.
