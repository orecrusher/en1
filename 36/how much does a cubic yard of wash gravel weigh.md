Hi Duncan. A cubic yard of gravel is one yard × one yard × one yard perhaps looking like this: If we slice it into 2 inch slices we have 36/2 = 18 slices each of them 2 inches thick with a top surface that measures one yard × one yard hence with an area of one square yard.. So if we just lay them out the total area is 18 × 1 yard 2 = 18 yards 2.
