## Manganese oxide minerals: Crystal structures and economic 
 · Manganese oxide minerals have been used for thousands of years—by the ancients for pigments and to clarify glass and today as ores of Mn metal alysts and battery material. More than 30 Mn oxide minerals occur in a wide variety of geological settings. They are major components of Mn nodules that pave huge areas of the ocean floor and bottoms of many fresh-water lakes.

Manganese is extracted from its oxide (Manganese dioxide or MnO 2 ) by using aluminium as the reducing agent. Because aluminium is more reactive than manganese and is placed above it in the reactivity series aluminium can easily displace manganese from its oxide to liberate the metal.

## Manganese 
Manganese. Manganese (element #25 symbol Mn) is a gray-white metal with a pinkish tinge and is very brittle but hard. It was discovered 1774 by Johann Gahn. Manganese easily reacts with water and air. On Earth manganese is never found as a free metal but it is found in a number of minerals. The most important of these minerals is

## Specifics Water treatment manganese removal 
Manganese is an element that is often found in the ground. Many manganese ores can be found mainly oxides (pyrolusite vernadite etc.) and occasionally carbonates (rhodochrosite) silies sulphides etc. In natural water manganese will usually be present in the soluble ionised form Mn 2+ and sometimes as MnOH + (very basic pH).

 · Silver cosolubilized with manganese during SO2 leaching is most likely intimately associated with the manganese oxides in the ore. Silver extracted by the cyanide solution after manganese removal by SO2 solutions was previously not accessible to the cyanide solution owing to the presence of manganese mineralization in pores and fluid channels.

## Reduction of Manganese Ores by Methane
Manganese oxides were reduced to carbide Mn7C3. High extent and rate of reduction by methane-containing gas in comparison with carbothermal reduction were attributed to high carbon activity in the reducing gas which was in the range 15 - 50 (relative to graphite). The reduction rate of Wessels manganese ore increased with increasing temperature.
