## Limits of the CIL circuit in copper–gold plants 
 · When low quality ores are processed and the gold price is decreased many copper–gold plants have to close the CIL circuit and discharge flotation tailings directly to the tailing dams. To recover the gold from flotation tailings it is important to understand limits of the CIL circuit and then develop an economically viable process.

## Simulation and Analysis of Carbon
Carbon in leach (CIL) is an important process in gold processing involving simultaneous leaching and adsorption. The process holds the key to profitability in gold extraction. While the mechanism of leaching and adsorption are well known the effect of different operating and design parameters on the CIL circuit performance is still empirical.

 · The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold. The Miller process is rapid and simple but it produces gold of only about 99.5 percent purity. The Wohlwill process increases purity to about 99.99 percent by electrolysis.

Carbon in leach (CIL) is an important step in gold processing that involves simultaneous adsorption and leaching. While the mechanism of leaching and adsorption are well known the effect of different operating and design parameters on the dynamics and performance of CIL circuit are not yet studied.
