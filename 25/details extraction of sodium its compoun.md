## Extraction and Washing Guide 
If your compound is somewhat water soluble - has several polar functional groups -you may need to back-extract the water layers with ether or ethyl acetate to avoid a significant loss to the aqueous phase. TLC can be used to determine when all of your compound has been removed from the water (see TLC Guide for details). 6)
