## theory about mill critical speed 
Ball mills have been successfully run at speeds between 60 and 90 percent of critical speed but most mills operate at speeds between 65 and 79 percent of critical speed. More The "Critical Speed" for a grinding mill is defined as the rotational speed where centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell's inside surface.

## Ball Mills 
If the peripheral speed of the mill is too great it begins to act like a centrifuge and the balls do not fall back but stay on the perimeter of the mill. The point where the mill becomes a centrifuge is called the "Critical Speed" and ball mills usually operate at 65% to 75% of the critical speed.

Critical speed depends upon the magnitude and loion of the shaft unbalance the length of the shaft its diameter and the kind of bearing support. Many practical appliions suggest as good practice that the maximum operating speed should not exceed 75% of the critical speed; however there are cases that require speeds above the critical speed to work correctly.
