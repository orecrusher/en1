## Steel making process – ArcelorMittal
Iron ore can be found all over the world but its iron content varies. Steel scrap has been selectively collected for several decades and is recycled as a valuable raw material for steel production. In the steel production following stages are identified: production of pig iron; production of liquid steel; hot rolling and cold rolling; applying a metallic and/or organic coating.
