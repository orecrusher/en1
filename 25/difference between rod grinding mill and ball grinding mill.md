## Ball Mills 
A Ball Mill grinds material by rotating a cylinder with steel grinding balls causing the balls to fall back into the cylinder and onto the material to be ground. The rotation is usually between 4 to 20 revolutions per minute depending upon the diameter of the mill. The larger the diameter the slower the rotation.

## Rod mills how they function 
Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded. For an equivalent grind a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore. The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition and broken and worn rods must be removed.
