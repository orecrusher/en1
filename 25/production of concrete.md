## Cement 
A cement is a binder a substance used for construction that sets hardens and adheres to other materials to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry or with sand and gravel produces concrete.Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water

## CEMENT and CONCRETE TECHNOLOGY
cement amounts can be reduced because concrete strength is directly related to the water/cement ratio. Definition of Mineral Admixtures Mineral admixtures include fly ash hydrated lime silica fume and ground blast furnace slag. Many of these materials have cement-like properties augmenting the strength and density of the finished concrete.

 · It is used in 98% of concrete globally today with 4bn tonnes produced each year. The production of Portland clinker which acts as the binder is a crucial step in making Portland cement. Limestone (CaCO3) is "calcinated" at high temperatures in a cement kiln to produce lime (CaO) leading to the release of waste CO2.

Cement production had to be mastered by women and teenagers. It was during the war that the first batch of oilwell cement used in the oil industry was released at Spassky Cement Plant. In June 1943 the production of 400 and 500 Grade pozzolanic cement developed with the participation of the Plant's specialists was launched.

Cement was produced at 96 plants in 34 States and at 2 plants in Puerto Rico. U.S. cement production continued to be limited by closed or idle plants underutilized capacity at others production disruptions from plant upgrades and relatively inexpensive imports. In 2019 sales of cement increased slightly and were valued at $12.5 billion.
