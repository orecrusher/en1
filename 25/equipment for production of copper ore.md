 · Sulfide Copper OresVirtually all sulfide-type copper ores including chalcocite (Cu 2 S) chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS) are treated by smelting.After crushing the ore to a fine powder it is concentrated by froth flotation which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that combine with the copper to make it hydrophobic.

Copper Appliions in Metallurgy of Copper Copper Alloys. Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels called adits to reach the ore.

Despite this early production most copper used in the United States was imported from Chile until 1844 when mining of large deposits of high-grade copper ore around Lake Superior began. The development of more efficient processing techniques in the late-1800s allowed the mining of lower-grade copper ores from huge open-pit mines in the western United States.
