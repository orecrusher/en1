## Copper Concentrates 
The production of concentrates implies the crushing and later milling of the ore down to a particle size allows releasing copper by flotation. The concentrates from different regions have approximately between 24% up to 36% of copper. Copper concentrates are then submitted to a final filtration and drying process to decrease the humidity to 8-9%.

## Copper Recovery Process From Copper Ore
Copper Recovery From Lean Sulfide Ores. Copper is recovered from ores containing about 10-15 percent copper in the form of a sulfide in the presence of significant amounts of iron and nickel by sulfatizing roasting the ore in an atmosphere including 5-15 percent so 2 at a temperature of from about 580c to about 625c and leaching soluble copper salt therefrom with water.
