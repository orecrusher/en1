flotation has gained importance in treating iron ore tailings in the recent years [15 16]. The flotation of iron ores is usually performed by reverse flotation using ionic or anionic collectors [17]. The reverse flotation using ionic collectors is the most popular flotation route for the upgradation of low-grade iron ores

the concentrate. One limitation with this calculation is that it uses the weights of the feed and concentrate. While this data is available in laboratory experiments in the plant it is likely that the ore is not weighed and only assays will be available. However it is possible to express the ratio of concentration in terms of ore assays.
