## [PDF] Study of Ceramic Slurries for Investment Casting 
Ice patterns generated by rapid freeze prototyping or a molding process can be used to make ceramic investment molds for metal castings. Due to the use of ice the ceramic slurries must be poured around the pattern and cured at sub-freezing temperatures. Success of this process depends greatly on the mold strength after the gelation of the slurries.

In general zircon flour is used as a primary slurry material in the ceramic shell investment casting process but it is very costly. Therefore continuous monitoring and control of viscosity can keep costs of the processes low with significant material savings reduced solvent use and optimal energy usage during the mixing process.

## Investment Casting 
Investment Casting. Investment casting also known as lost wax casting is the process in which a wax pattern is created and then that pattern is coated in a ceramic slurry to create the hardened mold for final casting. The term investment spawns from the process in which the wax pattern is coated with the ceramic slurry.

## Project Report on INVESTMENT CASTING 
In the investment casting process a ceramic slurry is applied or 'invested' around a disposable pattern usually wax and is allowed to harden to form a disposable casting mold. The wax pattern is 'lost' when it is melted out from the 'disposable' ceramic mold which is later destroyed to recover the casting.

The investment casting process consists of several steps: metal die construction wax pattern production ceramic mold creation pouring solidifiion shakeout and cleanup. 1. Metal die construction. The wax pattern and ceramic mold are destroyed during the investment casting process so each casting requires a new wax pattern.

Investment Casting Vs Die Casting Investment. Investment casting is limited to the size of part as the wax model must be safely sticked to the sprue and repeated dipped in the ceramic slurry.Die casting has less size limitation than investment casting and can creat larger components but it will cost more in both tooling cost and unit cost for larger products.

patterns. In the investment casting process a ceramic slurry is applied or 'invested' around a disposable pattern usually wax and is allowed to harden to form a disposable casting mold. The wax pattern is 'lost' when it is melted out from the 'disposable' ceramic mold which is later destroyed to recover the casting.
