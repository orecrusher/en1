## What is Industrial Sand? 
Silica sand deposits are most commonly surface-mined in open pit operations but dredging and underground mining are also employed. Extracted ore undergoes considerable processing to increase the silica content by reducing impurities. It is then dried and sized to produce the optimum particle size distribution for the intended appliion.
