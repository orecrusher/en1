A feature of ball mills is their high specific energy consumption; a mill filled with balls working idle consumes approximately as much energy as at full-scale capacity i.e. during grinding of material. Therefore it is most disadvantageous to use a ball mill at less than full capacity.

## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.
