## Screw Conveyor Sizing : Things to Know 
Screw Conveyor Sizing Flow Rate and Screw Size. Since the purpose of a screw conveyor is to move product from point A to point B you'll want to determine how fast you want the product to move (this is called the flow rate or capacity). Of course a screw conveyor can only hold so much material at one time but the bigger the screw inside the conveyor and the lighter the material the faster
