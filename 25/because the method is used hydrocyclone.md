hydrocyclone was first patented in1891 by Bretney and has been used for industrial purposes for more than 100 years. The internal flow field of the hydrocyclone was complex and the flow in the hydrocyclone was often described as a combination of an outer helical downward flow and an inner helical upward flow.

Generally hydrocyclones are used in continuous flow systems so that the instantaneous liquid inflow to the hydrocyclone is equal to the total instantaneous outflow of "lights" plus "heavies". In cases where "heavies" are a very small part of the whole liquid it is sometimes advantageous to accumulate them in the bottom of the hydrocyclone for batchwise removal.

## Improved Mining Operations by Detecting Roping and 
 · One of the most ubiquitous operations in any mine is the use of hydrocyclones (cyclones) This is the worst-case scenario because all the material within the cyclone is sent along to flotation. Traditional methods for detecting roping and plugging are many but the most popular technologies used are acoustics or ultrasonics.

Hydrocyclones are useful for the removal of suspended solids from ballast waters by liquid–solid and liquid–liquid separation. This technology is also effective for the dewatering of microalgae cultures.

Alumina is themon material used for hydrocyclone linings. Some examples of this are shown in Figs. 12.13 and 12.14. In rare cases silicon carbide is used however it is much more expensive than alumina in the order of three times the cost depending on the respective grades for only a marginally improved service life.
