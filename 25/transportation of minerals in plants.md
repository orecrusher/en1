## Short essay on the Transport system in Plants
Transport of Water and Minerals: Plants require water for making food by photosynthesis. Plants also need mineral salts for various purposes (such as making proteins etc.). Water and minerals are absorbed from the soil by the roots of the plant and transported to the various parts of the plant like stem leaves and flowers.

## Uptake of Minerals 
Plants depend on minerals from soil for its nutritional requirements. All minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots. Two factors account for this: (i) minerals are present in the soil as charged particles (ions) that cannot move across cell membranes and the concentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration of minerals in the root.

Plants obtain their supply of carbon and most of their oxygen from CO 2 of atmosphere hydrogen from water while the rest are minerals which are picked up individually from the soil. Minerals exist in the soil as ions which cannot directly cross the cell membranes.
