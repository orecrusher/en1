## What is the Lapping and Define the Process?
Pressure on work-piece The amount of pressure applied to the components being lapped can effect resulting surface roughness by altering the slurry film thickness. The higher the pressure (3 P.S.I. maximum for conventional lapping) the thinner the film thickness and the greater the chance of "wiping" the components against the lap plate.
