 · In belt drives power is transmitted between at least two pulleys by a belt. One pulley drives the belt ( driving pulley) and the other pulley is driven by the belt ( driven pulley ). In belt drives the speed is often reduced so that in these cases the smaller of the two pulleys is the driving pulley. Figure: Operating principle of a belt drive.

## Belt Theory 
For a flat belt drive the friction between the belt and pulley for a small segment of belt is =µ×𝑅 while for a V-belt/sheave with a 38° angle the friction would be =2.92 ×µ×𝑅 o The same hub load and stress in the tensile members gives V-belts nearly 3x the friction of flat belts.
