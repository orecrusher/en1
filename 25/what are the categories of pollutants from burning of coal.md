## Household air pollution and health
 · Indoor air pollution and energy: the forgotten 3 billion. Around 3 billion people still cook using solid fuels (such as wood crop wastes charcoal coal and dung) and kerosene in open fires and inefficient stoves. Most of these people are poor and live in low- and middle-income countries.

## Air Pollution 
How Do We Cause Air Pollution? We cause air pollution directly through our use of electricity fuels and transportation. We also cause air pollution indirectly when we buy goods and services that use energy in their production and delivery. Most of this air pollution we cause results from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal oil natural gas and gasoline to produce electricity and

Coal-fired power plants are responsible for a disproportionate amount of this pollution – though coal produced two-thirds of U.S. fossil fuel electricity coal plants emitted over 80 percent of fossil fuel global warming pollution. Coal plants emitted about one-third of the nation's total global warming pollution.

For example in case of Delhi all the coal-fired thermal power plants are outside Delhi (within 20-30 km) all the brick kilns are outside Delhi a majority of the industries are outside Delhi which means an emissions inventory drawn from within the administrative boundary of the city will miss the sources that are likely to contribute to the ambient air pollution.

Pollution Control We have methods that allow us to remove many of the solids liquids and gases emitted from coal and other fossil fuel fired power plants but adding these pollution control devices costs money. Governments and other organizations can enforce limits on effluents or encourage/require the use of pollution control technology.
