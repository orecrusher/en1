Strength of RCC is defined as compressive strength after 28 days expressed as M15 M20 where M stands for Mix and 15 stands for 15 N/mm 2 (n/mm 2 must be read as 'Newton's per millimeter Cubed) compressive strength at 28 days. The proportions of materials (cement sand coarse aggregate) for nominal mix/design mix concrete that are normally used are 1:3:6 or 1:4:8.

## Effect of Aggregates On Strength Of Concrete 
 · Aggregates gradation also have an influence on the compressive strength of concrete. Concrete strength increases when using dense gradation and increasing fines modulus of aggregates. By increasing fines modulus surface area of aggregates goes on increasing. With the increase in surface area more bond surface will be available and due to this stronger bond will be formed and also this

## Effect of Maximum Aggregate Size on the Strength of Normal 
The strength of (normal or high-strength) concrete is affected by the maximum size of a well-graded coarse aggregate. Concrete mixes containing larger coarse aggregate particles need less mixing water than those containing smaller coarse aggregates In other words small aggregate particles have more surface area than a large aggregate particle.
