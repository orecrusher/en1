## Mining With Microbes 
 · Harnessing microbes to do mining work is called biomining or sometimes bioextraction or bioleaching. The strategy has been most extensively studied for copper and gold: Colorado-based mining consultant Corale L. Brierley estimates that 10 to 15% of copper and 5% of gold worldwide are currently being harvested through biomining.

## microbes used inmining 
Microbes are playing increasingly important roles in commercial mining operations where they are being used in the "bioleaching" of copper uranium and gold ores. Direct leaching is when microbial metabolism changes the redox state of the metal being harvested rendering it more soluble.
