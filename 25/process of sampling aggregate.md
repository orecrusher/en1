## A Detailed Guide on Grading of Aggregates.
Grading of Aggregates. Grading of aggregates is determining the average grain size of the aggregates before they are used in construction. This is applied to both coarse and fine aggregates.The aggregate sample is sieved through a set of sieves and weights retained on each sieve in percentage terms are summed up.

Bagging is composed of two parts: aggregation and bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is a sampling method where a sample is chosen out of a set using the replacement method. The learning algorithm is then run on the samples selected. The bootstrapping technique uses sampling with replacements to make the selection procedure completely random.
