## Determination of ion exchange capacity and exchangeable 
INTRODUCTION There are numerous methods available for measuring the ion exchange capacity (CEC) of soils (Chapman 1965; Rhoades 1982).As with many other physical and chemical parameters the CEC value is the result of a particular state of equilibrium between the test sample and a given environment consisting of the reagent and the experimental conditions chosen.

## CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY BASE SATURATION
The ion exchange capacity of a soil is a measurement of its ability to bind or hold exchangeable ions. Knowing the CEC and total base saturation will also yield a lime requirement by calculating the amount of calcium necessary to achieve a target total base saturation (usually 75%).
