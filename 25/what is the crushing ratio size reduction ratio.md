## Odds ratios and risk ratios: what's the difference and why 
Odds ratios (OR) are commonly reported in the medical literature as the measure of association between exposure and outcome. However it is relative risk that people more intuitively understand as a measure of association. Relative risk can be directly determined in a cohort study by calculating a r

## Roll Crushers 
As stone passes through a crusher the reduction in size may be expressed as reduction ratio. The reduction ratio is the ratio of crusher feed size to product size. ROLL CRUSHER Roll crushers are used for producing additional reductions in the sizes of stone after the output of a quarry has been subjected to one or more stages of prior crushing

## Brewing ratios for espresso beverages 
 · Brewing ratio is the ratio of dry coffee used to liquid beverage produced. For example a 32 gram espresso shot prepared with 16 grams of coffee would have a brewing ratio of 16/32 or 50%. Previously I called this the "extraction ratio" but I believe "brewing ratio" is the more descriptive term. It is already used by the SCAA in defining

## How to Calculate Ratios: A Step
 · Equivalent ratios can be divided and/or multiplied by the same number on both sides so as above 12:4 is an equivalent ratio to 3:1. Ratios can inform you of the direct proportion of each number in comparison to the other. For example when a pair of numbers increase or decrease in the same ratio they are directly proportional.

 · The gap between cylinders can be adjusted so the size of crushed product is easily adjustable. Usually both cylinders are covered with manganese steel liners. Crushing ratio is usually lower than in other crushers. Roll crusher is suitable for fine crushing. The roll crusher uses compression to crush materials. Reduction ratio is 2 to 2.5 to 1.

 · If the master cylinder bore size is decreased the piston has to travel further to move the same amount of fluid. Typically a master cylinder has approximately 1-1/2-inch to 1-3/4-inch of stroke (travel). What you have to do is coordinate the pedal ratio with the bore size to arrive at approximately half of the stroke (roughly 1-inch) in order

These are the two main causes of sub-optimal crushing performance but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design. Surprisingly selecting the wrong alloy has no effect when it comes to the reduction ratio (although this will affect the life of wearable parts in your crusher).

Aspect ratio. An aspect ratio is the relationship between width and height of images. It is usually expressed as two numbers such as 3:2 4:3 or 16:9. The width is always the first number.
