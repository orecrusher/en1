## How ball bearings are manufactured 
 · Ball bearings are rolling element bearings that use balls to separate the bearing races and provide smooth low friction motion in rotary appliions. Ball bearings are manufactured in hundreds of sizes from the ultra-small 1.50 mm diameter bearing for use with miniaturized medical devices and micro-motors to bearings over 15 feet in diameter for use in heavy equipment.
