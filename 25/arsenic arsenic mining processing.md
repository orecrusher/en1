## How is arsenic mined and processed? 
When smelters heat this ore to retrieve the other metals the arsenic is often released into the air as dust. Arsenic is also found in coal and can be released through coal-fired power plants or incinerators that burn arsenic-containing products. Arsenic itself is also mined and used in industrial processes.
