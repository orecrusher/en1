## Production 
To make iron from the ore it is reduced and melted in a blast furnace with coke at over 1300°C. The resulting pig iron contains more than 2% carbon and cannot be used for products in this form. It is only through the LD process that the pig iron is converted into steel by blowing it with pure oxygen.

## Iron Ore Processing Flowsheet 
Iron ore processing depend mainly on the type of ROM ore feed and optimum product. Dry screening into lumps and fines is practised for high quality flaky ore and blue dust because if wet treatment is used a substantial part of good quality material is rejected in the form of slimes.

## Raw materials 
 · Raw materials. For the production of steel there is a need for iron raw material in the form of iron ore or scrap metal together with alloying elements so that the material acquires the desired for properties. In the production of ore-based steel coal is also needed as a reducing agent and limestone as a slag former.

Approximately three-quarters of the iron ore used by domestic integrated steel mills to make iron and steel originated in the United States in 1998. Brazil Canada and Venezuela accou nted for more than 90% of iron ore imports which average about 15 million metric tons per year. Domestic consumption of iron ore was about 78 Mt in 1998.
