 · Vertical Milling Machines. In vertical mills the spindle axis is vertically oriented. Milling cutters are held in the spindle and rotate on its axis. Typically the spindle can be extended or the table raised or lowered to produce the same effect allowing for plunge cuts and drilling. The two kinds of vertical mills are bed mills and turret mills.

Abstract Vertical roller mills (VRM) have found appliions mostly in cement grinding operations where they were used in raw meal and finish grinding stages and in power plants for coal grinding. The mill combines crushing grinding classifiion and if necessary drying operations in one unit and enables to decrease number of equipment in grinding circuits.
