## [Loion Factors] Aluminium
 · Bauxite occurs frequently in the tropical areas where limestone rocks are exposed to weathering; First Bauxite ore is crushed washed and mixed with caustic soda to remove impurities. Then it is dried in large furnaces to remove moisture content=> you get alumina. During this phase ~50% or more weight loss happens.

## Aluminium production process
ALUMINA PRODUCTION. Bauxite is crushed dried and ground in special mills where it is mixed with a small amount of water. This process produces a thick paste that is collected in special containers and heated with steam to remove most of the silicon present in bauxites. The ore is loaded into autoclaves and treated with lime–caustic soda.
