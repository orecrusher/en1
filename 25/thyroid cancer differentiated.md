The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased worldwide 3- to 15-fold over the last two decades but with no significant increase in mortality (Pellegriti et al. 2013 Ahn et al. 2014).The increase in incidence is largely attributable to increased detection of differentiated thyroid cancer ((DTC) – i.e. papillary and follicular cancer) (Burgess Tucker 2006 Davies Welch
