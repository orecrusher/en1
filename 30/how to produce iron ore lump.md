## Maximizing lump production in Iron ore extraction
Iron ore contains lumps of varying size the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch). The blast furnace requires lumps between 7 and 25 millimetres so the ore must be crushed to reduce the maximum particle size. Fines particles < 7 millimetres must first be agglomerated reforming them into lumps of suitable size by a process called sintering and then be processed in blast furnaces to produce iron.

## Changing dynamics of iron ore pellets industry 
 · Globally around two billion tonnes of iron ore (average 62%) is used in the form of lumps/sinter/pellets to produce steel. However the reserves of high-grade ore are depleting rapidly due to which the adoption of beneficiation technologies such as sintering and pelletizing to utilise fine ore and low-grade ore is attracting heightened attention in the industry.

 · Alternatively the dressed ore can be used to produce iron-rich sinters i.e. semi-fused and solidified lumps of iron oxide. Previously the ore-based steelworks in Sweden had their own sinter plants but nowadays pellets are mainly used as a feedstock in the production of ore-based steel. The last Swedish sinter plant was shut down in 1995.
