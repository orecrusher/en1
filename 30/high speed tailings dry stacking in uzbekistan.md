## Best Practices for Tailings Dam Design 
 · Background. Recent major tailings dam failures have led to an industry-wide review of the design and management of tailings storage facilities. Before the 1960s mine tailings were often disposed directly into ponds lakes rivers or natural topographic depressions or stored in impoundments supported by earthen dams without necessarily applying engineering principles (McLeod et al. 2015).

## Atmosphere Interaction and Capillary Barrier in Filtered 
 · Filtered tailings (FT) is an alternative waste disposal technology that offers several advantages relative to water consumption and land usage when compared to conventional slurry tailings dams (Davies and Rice 2001; Davies 2011).It consists in reducing the water content of tailings ahead of their final disposal and later storing them in stacks with no containment structures.

## Dewatering processing tailings with centrifuges
Dewatering tailings makes it possible to store dry processed sludge. Dry storage means a lower risk. The amount of wastewater in the settling ponds and the pressure on the dams is reduced. This significantly reduces environmental risks. Flottweg decanter centrifuges for dewatering tailings are manufactured only in Germany.

After settling and self-weight consolidation the dry density of the undesiced tailings is a function of the G s of the tailings solids. For coal tailings the dry density is about 1.8 t/m 3 due to their low G s while for metalliferous tailings the dry density is up to 1.5 t/m 3 due to their higher G s.
