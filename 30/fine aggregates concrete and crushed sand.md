## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete 
Aggregate is a granular material such as sand gravel crushed stone used with a cement to produce either concrete or mortar. Aggregate is relatively inexpensive and does not enter into complex chemical reactions with water; it has been customary therefore to treat it as inert filler in concrete and mortar.

## Aggregates 
Aggregates: Aggregates are inert granular substances like either sand gravel or crushed stone which are an important component in concrete alongside water and portland cement.. Aggregates must be pure hard solid particles free from ingested chemicals or adhesives of clay as well as other fine materials for a good concrete mix that could trigger the concrete to deteriorate.
