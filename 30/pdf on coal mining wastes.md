On October 11 2000 a coal waste impoundment broke into an underground coal mine in Martin County Kentucky releasing over 300 million gallons of slurry. Slurry poured into the mine and discharged from two mine portals contaminating miles of creeks and rivers. Fortunately no miners were in the mine at the time of the failure and no one was

Coal mining played a supportive role as provider of energy to the growing gold mining industry and indeed many collieries were historically and are today owned by gold mining companies. To these coal mine owners it was more important to keep the costs of their own energy inputs low than to profit from coal mining itself4. The coal

 · coal mining wastes is about 15% of coal production which varies from 10% to 30% with the change of geological and mining conditions. Therefore it is estimated that the annual production of coal mining wastes is about 315 million tons for underground coal mining after 2005 which accounts for a quarter of total industrial solid wastes.
