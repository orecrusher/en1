The degree of milling performed on the ore depends on the gold concentration of the ore mineralogy and hardness of the ore the mill's capacity and the next planned step for recovery. Milled ore is pumped to the next operation unit in the form of a slurry.

The ultra-fine gold particles associated with sulfide minerals are often too small to recover by gravity and very expensive to liberate by grinding.

## 3 Technologies in Exploration Mining and Processing 
 · Some recent grinding installations in Australia have demonstrated potential for ultra-fine grinding with acceptable power consumption (Johnson 1998). A combination of high-pressure rolls and ultra-fine grinding devices could potentially save energy in the production of ultra-fine particles because they create micro-cracks during the crushing step.

processing consists of crushing and grinding raw materials followed if necessary by size classifiion and raw materials calcining and drying. The processed raw material then may be dry-mixed with other minerals and chemical compounds packaged and shipped as product. All of these processes are not required for some refractory products.

Understanding the mineral processing techniques can help to determine how tailings are produced and the challenges associated with their storage. Run of the mine ore is physically reduced by crushing and grinding methods (figure 2). The optimum degree of grinding is determined by the extraction methods used to remove the economic product.
