Iron limiting states: iron is exported out of the enterocyte via a transporter (ferroportin) loed in the basolateral membrane. It then binds to the iron-carrier transferrin for transport throughout the body. Iron in the form of heme from ingestion of hemoglobin or myoglobin is also readily absorbed.
