## Gold extraction 
Comminution is the process where ore particles are liberated from gangue material through progressive size reduction in the form of crushing grinding cutting or vibrating. The costs associated with power supply grinding media and liners used in comminution circuits almost always represent the single largest cost in gold extraction processes (Mosher 2005).
