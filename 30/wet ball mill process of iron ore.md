Beneficiation can vary significantly from one ore type to the next. In most cases however beneficiation is carried out through a wet process that necessitates a subsequent drying step.

 · Each mill measures about 12 metres in diameter and has an internal volume of 1220 cubic metres. As the AG mill turns the ore crushes against itself and breaks apart. From the AG mills the ore travels to the primary magnetic separators where the iron is drawn away from the waste material before it's screened and fed into the ball mills.
