## Propagation characteristics of pulverized coal and gas two 
 · As a whole pulverized coal flow has a negative impact on gas flow which makes a great loss of large amounts of initial energy blocking the propagation of gas flow. According to comparison of numerical results for different roadway types the attenuation effect of T-type roadways is best.

## Construction and working principle of Pulverized Coal Burners
 · The rapidity of air-coal mixing known as turbulence plays important role in finding the main difference between the various burners. The turbulent type of burner is applied in the bituminous coals and the burners with long flame can be used for low volatile coals. The requirements which should be met by a pulverized coal burner are:

## Different Types of Coal 
The ability to blend different types of coal enables some coals which do not coke well to be used with higher grade coals to form an acceptable mix. Developments in blast furnace technology (pulverized coal injection in particular) have also allowed lower quality coals to be used in steelmaking in place of a portion of the coke.
