Gold occurs in offshore placer deposits off the coast of Nome particularly from a point west of the mouth of the Nome River to near Penny River. From about 1960 to 1991 and especially from 1987 to 1990 there has been significant exploration and gold production. From mean lower low tide the auriferous deposits extend seaward for about 2 miles.
