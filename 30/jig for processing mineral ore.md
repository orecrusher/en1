## OPTIMIZATION OF JIGGING PROCESS USING STATISTICAL TECHNIQUE
Jigging is a process of ore concentration carried out in any fluid whose effectiveness depends on differences in specific gravity of granular mineral particles. It consists of separation of the particles into layers of different specific gravities followed by the removal of the separated layers [1].
