## Gabbro with Tourmaline and Pyrite (Scotland) 
Gabbro is an igneous rock which exhibits a phaneratic coarse grained texture with crystals being visible with the naked eye. It is an intrusive rock composed of mafic minerals such as pyroxenes mainly augite along with plagioclase feldspars and minor occurrences of amphibole and olivine the latter of which can give the rock which is a grey colour a slightly green tint.

## Schist 
Schist (/ ʃ ɪ s t / shist) is a medium-grained metamorphic rock showing pronounced schistosity.This means that the rock is composed of mineral grains easily seen with a low-power hand lens oriented in such a way that the rock is easily split into thin flakes or plates.This texture reflects a high content of platy minerals such as micas talc chlorite or graphite.
