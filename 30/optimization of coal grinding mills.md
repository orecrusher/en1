## Optimization of Crushers and Mills 
Optimization of Crushers and of Mills Crushing and grinding technology is used to reduce particle size of solid materials such as limestone ore coal or other materials. The process requires a lot of specific forces (typically impact shear and/or compression) which is challenging for the crusher / mill

## Raw Material Drying
Inertization of coal mill circuit and fine coal bins with CO2 N2 or CO2+N2 to replace O2 which promotes spontaneous ignition of fine coal. Vertical roller mills can typically handle an aggregate moisture of up to 20% in raw materials and consumes about 30% less power in grinding.

## Coal Mill Performance Optimisation 
COAL MILL PERFORMANCE OPTIMISATION Continued. Coal is first crushed by coal crushers to a size of 20 to 25 mm and is then fed to coal bunkers. Coal feeders feed this crushed coal continuously to coal mill as per requirement. Coal gets ground by grinding elements in stages. Coal particles get re-circulated around four times before achieving
