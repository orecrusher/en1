 · Mostly normal refractory brick created of natural fire clay is as good as acid brick but if additional acid resistance is required then an additional amount of silica is added to on fire clay which may range up to 97% of its composition.. For binding bases 1 to 2% lime may be added on.Acid bricks are burnt at large temperatures for lengthy periods.
