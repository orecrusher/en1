## Impact of Mining On The Environment
Mining is the source of the substances that cannot be received through industrial procedures or agricultural progresses. The impact of mining on the environment has been a major issue for decades while nature has evolved with positive and negative aspects. There are several mining procedures like hydraulic mining and this mining technique is usually used for extracting gold from the mine.

## Environmental Impact 
Copper mining and copper processing have environmental impacts starting with the impact on the earth by enormous open-pit mines all the way through the processing process and the toxic by-products produced. Another environmental impact of copper is through the use of copper compounds as wood preservatives fungicides and pesticides.

## The environmental impact of gold production
The stages that contributed the most to gold's environmental impact were mining and comminution (crushing and grinding of the ore). Electricity use was responsible for just over half of the GHG emissions. This indies that attempts to lessen the environmental impact of gold production should focus on these two stages.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Strip mining destroys landscapes forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees plants and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams sediments pollute waterways. This can hurt fish and smother plant life downstream and cause disfiguration of river channels and
