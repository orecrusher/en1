## Iron Ore Mining 
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.
