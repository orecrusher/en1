 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## Iron Extraction by Blast Furnace Metallurgy 
Iron when extracted from iron ore such as haematite containing iron (III) oxide Fe2O3 in a blast furnace is called iron extraction blast furnace metallurgy. In this reduction reaction oxygen is removed from the iron (III) oxide to leave behind iron. Generally the extraction of metals and their isolation are based on three major procedures.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

Iron is extracted from the ore containing the maximum amount of iron. This is found near the surface of the Earth. Iron ore is converted to iron by various processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to extract pig iron. Pig iron comprises of about 92-94% iron and about 3-5% of carbon along with other impurities.
