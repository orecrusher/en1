Bentonite (/ ˈ b ɛ n t ə n aɪ t /) is an absorbent swelling clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite.It usually forms from weathering of volcanic ash in seawater which converts the volcanic glass present in the ash to clay minerals. Bentonite beds are white or pale blue or green in fresh exposures turning to a cream color and then yellow red or brown as the exposure is weathered further.
