The melt emerging from the holes in the heated pelletiser die face (1) are cut off by rotating knives (2).The pellets are flung outward by the centrifugal force into a rotating water ring (3).This cools the pellets and transports them via a flexible discharge channel to the to the pellet water removal screen (4).The pellets pass through the oversize particle separator to the drying centrifuge.

## Pelletising 
Pelletising. Directing heated and cooled air where it is needed and recycling heat to save energy. Whether using the straight grate process or adding a rotary kiln to make the grate-kiln process our products are key to the process. To dry and heat the ore pellets a number of fans are used to recycle heat from the kiln.

 · The process of enriching taconite ore involved grinding the ore to remove gangues and upgrading the iron ore (i.e. an ore beneficiation process). The resultant high grade ore is in the form of fine particles as small as 0.1 mm or less which are not suitable for sintering. This issue led to the development of the pelletizing process.

## Pelletization 
Pelletizing is the most widely used process for the size reduction of many thermoplastic materials including raw polymers and mixed compounds. The process involves extrusion through a die. The extrudate is cooled to solidifiion and then cut into pellets or the molten extrudate is cut as it emerges from the extrusion die and the pellets are subsequently cooled.

The pelleting process. During the pelleting process (Figure 1) mash feed is heated in a conditioner using steam to reach a given temperature. Dry steam is added at a steam injection point at a ratio of 1% (1kg / 100kg mash) for every 15 o C increase in feed temperature as required. Final temperatures in the conditioner vary from 65 o C to 90 o C or even higher.
