As finer sizes of coal are washed new techniques will be used. In the accompanying flow sheet for the Homer City coal-washing plant of the Penelec Co. shown as Fig. 6 there is a heavy-medium cyclone which receives the underflow of a 2 mm x 0 classifying cyclone which makes a split at 100 mesh. Thus the cyclone input is sized at 2mm x 100 mesh.
