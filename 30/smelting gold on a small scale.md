Gold deposits along the general gold path can be small or large depending upon the size of the gold trap. The most important type of gold trap in river mining is called the "pay-streak". Pay-streaks always form along the gold path where the river's flow slows down on a large scale during a major flood storm.

## Deadwood South Dakota – Western Mining History
By the late 1880s smelting using iron pyrite was being tested as an alternative in a process called pyritic smelting. A small-scale plant named the Deadwood and Delaware Smelter (D D) was built in Deadwood to try out the experimental method in 1889. Fuel for the furnace was coke or coal and was imported by train from West ia or Wyoming.

If pure gold is required additional refining steps are necessary to separate out the gold. While this procedure can be used on the very small scale (roughly up to 10 grams) such as in fire assay its use on a small to medium scale (roughly 100 grams to 10 kg) is not recommended because it emits copious quantities of toxic lead oxide fumes.
