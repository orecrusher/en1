## What Are the Mix Ratios for Cement and Sand?
 · Follow Us: Westend61/Westend61/Getty Images. The basic mix ratio for concrete is one part water two parts cement and three parts sand. An alternative ratio is one part cement two parts sand and three parts gravel with enough water added until the mixtures reaches the consistency of thick mud. Lime is also a common additive to the mix.
