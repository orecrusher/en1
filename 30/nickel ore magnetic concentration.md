## Carrying nickel ore: The world's most dangerous cargo 
 · In the following article Mr. John Wilson Technical Services Asia American PI Club (Hong Kong Office) explains why nickel ore is considered as 'the world's most dangerous cargo'. Between 2010 and 2013 six vessels that loaded nickel ore in Indonesia sank during their voyages to China resulting in the loss of life of 81 seafarers.

## International Journal of Mineral Processing
Recently several investigations on the reduction roasting of nickel laterite ore followed by magnetic separation to produce ferronickel concentrate have been performed. Kim et al. have investigated the concentration of nickel from low-grade laterite (Ni 1.50% TFe 22.33%) using calcination at 500 °C for 1 hour and wet magnetic separation.

Then limonite nickel ore was mixed with reducing agent and additive. In addition the limonite nickel ore which was mixed with the reducing agent and additive was reduced in muffle furnace carbolite at certain temperature and time. Reduction result was weighed and concentrated by magnetic separation process and the result was analysed

The highest concentration of nickel was found in the smallest particles emitted from a coal-fired plant (20). Particles with an MMD of 0.65–1.1 µm contained nickel at a concentration of 1600 mg/kg while particles of 4.7–11 µm contained 400 mg/kg.

## Enhanced methods for nickel recovery from low
Whether high-grade or low-grade nickel ores need to be processed after mining in order to upgrade their nickel content from 1-4% Ni to 10-20%. Concentrating the nickel ores usually takes place close to the mine site and involves chemical and physical processes to crush the ore and separate the nickel-bearing and gangue minerals.

## Nickel 
Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. It is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room temperature the others being iron cobalt and gadolinium.Its Curie temperature is 355 °C (671 °F) meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel

## Calcination of low
Since the ore contains both Ni and Fe the calcination of laterite is effective in altering the crystalline structure of Fe species and therefore its magnetic properties which in turn enable the selective concentration of nickel by magnetic separation that is an easy and environmentally-friendly technique.

 · An interesting aspect of the magnetic separation of ore S (and partially ore I) is the enrichment of Mn in the magnetic concentrate. The amount of Mn was increased about 4 times from 0.4% and 0.2% in ores S and I respectively to 1.6% and 0.8% in the magnetic concentrates. The amount of Mn in the corresponding tails is more or less zero.
