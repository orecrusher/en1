Mining : digging or blasting to obtain the copper ore from the surrounding rock Crushing : mined copper ore is crushed into very small pieces ; Grinding : crushed copper ore is ground into a powder; Concentrating by flotation (also known as froth flotation or as ore flotation). Mining produce ores containing 2% or less of copper.

## What drives GHG emissions from copper production 
 · Ore head grade (i.e. copper and valuable by-product content) as this determines the mass or ore that must be moved and processed to recover a given unit of copper. The mining method and geometry especially for open pits as this determines the quantity of waste that must be moved (determined by stripping ratio) and the length and elevation of ore and waste movement.

Crushing is done in three stages. A primary jaw crusher loed close to the ore storage bins does the first stage crushing. The crushed ore is transported from the crusher to a double deck screen by a conveyor. The top screen (+35 mm) and the bottom screen (+18 mm) oversized material are combined and sent to a cone crusher.

Mining. Although large copper deposits are mined by open-cut methods in many of the major producing countries most of the copper ore produced in Australia comes from underground mines. The traditional method used at most mines involves the ore being broken and brought to the surface for crushing.

## Copper Environmental Profile 
Primary copper production starts with the extraction of copper-bearing ores. There are two basic ways of copper mining: surface and underground mining. Due to copper being spread in relatively low concentrations over large areas surface or open-pit mining is the predominant mining method for copper in the world.

In most cases the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3–8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6–40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15–90 days duration for copper oxides and 10–18 months for sulfides. Of note 80%–85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.

Copper is also extracted from oxidised ores including copper silies carbonates and sulphates. Here the copper ores are crushed and ground as above but they are then leached with sulphuric acid to produce an impure copper sulphate solution. The solution is purified using solvent extraction and electrode twinning.
